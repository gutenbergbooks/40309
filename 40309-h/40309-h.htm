<p class="nidt">erhaps one of the great social faults
of the American is, that he does
not amuse himself enough, at least
in a cheerful, innocent manner.
We are never jolly. We are terribly
troubled about our dignity.
All other nations, the French, the
German, the Italian, and even the
dull English, have their relaxation,
their merry-making; but we&mdash;why,
a political or prayer-meeting
is about the most hilarious affair
in which we
ever indulge.
The French
peasant has
his <i>ducas</i> almost every week, when in some rustic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
orchard, lighted with variegated lamps, ornamented
with showy booths, he dances the merry hours
away with Pauline and Josephine, or sips his glass
of wine with the chosen of his heart in a canvas
cabaret, whilst the music of a band and the voices of
a hundred merry laughers regale his ears. He has,
too, numberless <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, which he celebrates with
masquerades and other undignified kinds of jollification.
At these entertainments all are welcome,
high and low, and all conduct themselves with a
politeness worthy of our best society&mdash;<i>only more</i>.
We, the writer of this, have often and often danced
at these <i>bals champ&ecirc;tres</i> with a hired girl, a cook, or
a nurse for our partner. Does it not sound plebeian?
The Germans enjoy endless festivals and
gift periods, when they have the meanness to
offer each other little presents "that an't worth
more than two or three cents;" but they are tokens
of love and kindness, which make them all feel better
and happier. Then our grumpy friend, John
Bull, has his free-and-easies, and his cosy tavern
parlor-meetings, and song-singings, and his dinner-parties,
and his tea-fights, at which latter, be the
host rich or poor, you will get a good cup of tea,
and tender muffins, and buttered toast, and cake,
and shrimps, and fresh radishes, and Scotch marmalade,
or similar delicacies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>A delightful repast and a cosy chat, followed,
perhaps, by a rubber of whist and a glass of wine or
whiskey-punch, or mug of ale, according to the condition
of the entertainer; then there is a general
"unbending of the bow," and no one is troubled
about his dignity. We have seen, ourselves, in
England, in a stately old castle, a party of lords
and ladies&mdash;for we, like the boy who knew what
good victuals were, having been from home several
times&mdash;even we have seen good company&mdash;we
say that we have seen a party of lords and ladies,
knights and dames of high degree, and of mature
years, romping and frolicking together, like a lot of
children, playing <i>Hunt the Slipper</i>, <i>Puss in the
Corner</i>, <i>and Blindman's Buff</i>, without the remotest
idea that they had such a thing as dignity to take
care of; and no one seemed to have the slightest
fear that any one of the party could by any possibility
do anything that would offend or mortify any
one else. The fact is, gentlemen or gentlewomen
can do anything; all depends on the way of doing
it. If you are a snob, for heaven's sake don't be
playful; keep a stiff upper lip and look grave; it is
your only safety.</p>

<p>However, we are improving. We have skating
clubs. We play cricket and base ball. We dine
later, and take things a trifle more leisurely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Theatre-going, our chief amusement, can hardly be
reckoned a healthy relaxation, though well enough
now and then. Sitting in a cramped attitude, in a
stifling atmosphere, is not conducive to moral or
physical development. What we need are informal
social gatherings, where we may laugh much and
think little, and where dignity won't be invited;
where we need not make ourselves ill with bad
champagne and ice-starch, nor go into the other
extreme of platitudes, ice-water and doughnuts:
but where both body and mind will be treated considerately,
tenderly, generously.</p>

<p>Now we are going to give a few hints that may
help to make little meetings such as we mention
pass pleasantly; and should any of our austere
readers be afraid to risk our programme in full, they
can call in the children and make them shoulder
the responsibility. "It is," you can say, "a child's
party," and then you can enjoy all the fun yourself.
The juveniles will not object.</p>

<p>If merely for the purpose of promoting conversation,
something ought to be <i>done</i>, on all occasions
of social gatherings, something to talk about, something
that will afford people an excuse for getting
from their seats, something to bring people together,
something to break the ice. We have seen
a whole party of very estimable people sit round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
room for hours together in an agony of silence, only
broken now and then by a small remark fired off by
some desperate individual, in the forlorn hope that
he would bring on a general conversation.</p>

<p>In our little sketches we shall be discursive,
erratic, and unsystematic, just as the fancy takes
us. Still, there will be a method in our madness;
we shall try to give in each chapter a programme
somewhat suited to some one season, and of sufficient
variety and quantity to afford amusement for
one evening.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first place, we must remark, in a general
way, that we like a large centre-table. It is something
to rally round, it is handy to put things on,
and convenient for the bashful to lean against. On
this table I would accumulate picture-books, toys,
and knick-knacks&mdash;little odds and ends which will
serve as subjects for conversation. If you can do
no better, make a pig out of a lemon and four lucifer
matches, or an alligator out of a carrot. But we
will give some detailed instructions on this point
in a future chapter. Any simple puzzles, numbers
of which can be made out of cards, will be found
helpful. Take, for example, a common visiting-card,
and bend down the two ends, and place it on
a smooth table, as represented in the annexed
diagram, and then ask any one to blow it over.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>This seems easy enough; yet it is next door to an
impossibility. Still, it is to be done by blowing
sharply and not too hard on the table, about an
inch from the card. Another little trick consists
in making a coin (if such a thing is to be found
nowadays) stick to the door. This is done by
simply making a little notch with a knife on the
edge of the coin, so that a small point of metal may
project, which, when it is pressed against the woodwork,
will penetrate, and so cause the dime or
half-dime to appear to adhere magically to a perpendicular
surface. When you have exhibited one or
two tricks of this kind, some other member of the
party may have something to show. Then, having
secured the confidence of your audience, you may
venture to play a hoax upon them. Never mind
how trifling or how old these things are, they will
serve the purpose of making people talk. Say, for
example: "Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will show
a trick that is worth seeing. There are only two
people in the United States that can execute it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&mdash;myself
and the Siamese Twins. First of all, I must
borrow two articles from two ladies&mdash;a pocket-handkerchief
and&mdash;a boot-jack." Of course no one
has the boot-jack; so, pretending to be a little disappointed,
you say: "Never mind; I must do
without it. Will some gentleman be kind enough
to lend me three twenty-dollar gold pieces?" Of
course no one has these, either; so you content
yourself with borrowing two cents. You place one
in each hand, and extending your arms wide apart,
assure your audience that you will make both pennies
pass into one hand without bringing your arms
together. This you do by laying one on the mantel-piece,
and turning your whole body round, your
arms still extended, till the hand containing the
other coin comes over the place where you laid
down the cent; then you quietly take it up, and the
trick is performed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="640" height="220" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>After a little conversation, you can try something
which requires a little more preparation. The servant,
whom you have previously instructed, comes
into the room and announces that "that" gentleman
has called to look at the pictures. You desire
him to be shown in, and a short, broad-shouldered
man makes his appearance. Soon after he enters,
he turns his back on the company and begins to
examine the works of art on the wall, lengthening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and shortening his body to suit the height of the
object he wishes to inspect. This is performed by
your little brother or son, aided by a broom, a
couple of cloaks, and a hat. How, you will doubtless
be able to understand by looking at the subjoined
picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="462" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Another trick of the same order can be per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>formed
in this wise: The servant comes in to
inform you that a naughty little boy&mdash;Jacky or
Willy&mdash;in another room won't eat his custard, but
will cry for ice-cream, or roast-beef, or alligator-soup.
Every one is invited into the room to see
this singular child. You find him seated on a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
chair, with a very dirty face, making grimaces.
You take the dish of custard in one hand and a
large spoon (the larger the better) in the other, and
begin to expostulate with him on his perversity, but
all to no effect; he only cries and makes faces.
You then tell him if he does not behave better you
will be obliged to knock his head off. He continues
not to behave better, whereupon you give
him a tap with the spoon, and, to the surprise of all,
his head rolls off on to the floor. Your audience
then find out that the naughty boy was made of a
pillow and a few children's clothes, whilst the head
was supplied by Master Jacky or Willy, ingeniously
concealed behind the chair.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>A good practical joke to play in a rollicking
party, where you can venture to do it, is that of
mesmerizing; you of course manage beforehand to
lead the conversation to the subject of mesmerism,
then profess to have wonderful powers in that line
yourself. After more or less persuasion, allow
yourself to be induced to operate. You then say:</p>

<p>"Well, I will try if there is any person in the
company who is susceptible to the magnetic influence.
It is only in rare cases we find this susceptibility;
the person must be of exquisitely fine
organization and steady nerve. Few people can
look one long enough in the face to come under the
influence; and, if the current be suddenly broken,
the result is apt to be very serious, if not fatal, by
producing suspended action of the heart and vital
organs generally."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Having now fully impressed on your audience the
absolute necessity of keeping still, you begin to
look into the eyes of different persons, press their
hands, make passes at them, etc., as though you were
searching for the right temperament. At last you
come to your intended victim, and pronounce him
just the man. You now seat him in a chair, whilst
you go into another room to prepare the necessary
implements. These are two plates, each having on
it a tumblerful of water. One plate, however, must
be thoroughly blackened at the bottom, by holding
it in the smoke of a lamp or candle. This done,
you carry the plates and tumblers into the audience,
and hand the one which is black to the victim, who
is seated in a chair.</p>

<p>Before commencing operations, you must warn
the audience that it is absolutely necessary that
they observe strict silence, as the least word
or exclamation will break the charm, and be
attended with painful effects to both operation
and operatee. You may tell how, after being once
disturbed in this manner, you had most painful
shooting-pains in your nose for fifteen minutes, that
being the point in contact with your finger at the
moment of interruption. All this is to prevent
any one giving vent to some exclamation calculated
to betray the trick to your victim.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>You now seat yourself opposite the subject, and
desire him to keep his eyes steadily on yours, and
imitate the motions of your fingers. You then commence.
First, you dip your finger in the water,
and draw it down the centre of your nose; he does
the same; then you rub the bottom of your plate
with your fingers, and draw it over your chin; he
follows your example, and makes a black smudge on
his face; you rub the bottom of the plate again, and
draw your finger over your nose, and so on for
several minutes, till the victim has smeared himself
all over with black. You then rise and compliment
him on the steadiness with which he underwent
the ordeal, adding, however, that he has too
powerful a nervous organization for you to operate
on. The victim will generally rise with a rather
complacent smile at these compliments, at which
point the audience will generally explode with
laughter. The victim looks puzzled&mdash;more laughter&mdash;the
victim, thinking they are laughing at your
failure, joins in the merriment, which generally has
the effect of convulsing every one, when the climax
is reached by handing a mirror to the unhappy
operatee, who usually looks glum, and does not see
much fun in the joke.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>We will now describe a little party we attended
at a country house one Christmas, some years ago;
and should any of our readers find aught in the
entertainment they think worth copying, they can
do so.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="640" height="178" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When we arrived at Nix's house all the company
had assembled&mdash;it consisted of about ten grown
people and a dozen children. All were in a chatter
over a couple of little objects on the centre-table.
The one a pig manufactured out of a lemon, and
the other a dragon, or what not, adapted from a
piece of some kind of root our friend Nix had
picked up in the garden. We alluded to these
works of art in our last chapter, and now give
a couple of sketches of them. As will be seen,
they are very easy of manufacture, and not excessively
exciting when made, but they serve to set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>people talking. One person told the story of Foote,
or some other old wit, who, at a certain dinner-table,
after numerous fruitless efforts to cut a pig
out of orange-peel, retorted on his friend who was
quizzing him on his failure: "Pshaw! you've only
made one pig, but (pointing to the mess on the
table) I have made a litter." Then some one else
discovered a likeness between the dragon and a
mutual friend, which produced a roar of laughter.
Then a child exclaimed, "Oh! what a little pig!"
and some one answered her: "Yes, my dear, it's a
pigmy." Then a young lady asked how the eyes
were painted, and a young gentleman replied:
"With pigment." Whereupon a small boy called
out, "Go in lemons!" which was considered rather
smart in the small boy, and he was told so, which
induced him to be unnecessarily forward and pert
for the rest of the evening; but as he never succeeded
in making another hit, he gradually simmered
down to his normal condition towards the
end of the entertainment. One group got into con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>versation
about the dragon, the dragon led to
fabulous animals generally, fabulous animals to antediluvian
animals, these to pre-Adamite animals, and
so in a few minutes they were found deep in the
subject of Creation; whilst the group next to them,
owing to some one's having conjectured whether my
friend's piece of sculpture could walk, and some one
else having suggested that it might be made to do
so by means of clock-work or steam, had got on to
the subject of machinery, modern improvements,
flying-machines, and were away two thousand years
off in the future, making a difference of no less than
ten thousand years between themselves and the
other party. At about this juncture of affairs, we
happened to notice a book on the table treating of
a certain very interesting animal, the newly discovered
African ape, a subject which was attracting
a good deal of attention at that time. We took the
work in our hand and read on the cover the inscription:
"Portrait of the Gorilla." "Nix," we said to
our friend, still holding the book in our hand,
"if all we hear of this gorilla be true, it must be
a most extraordinary animal, although I am rather
inclined to be sceptical in the matter; however, I
have no right, perhaps, to form an opinion, as I
have never looked into the subject; but I'll get
you to lend me this book to-morrow. I will take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the greatest care of it, and return it; yes, I will, upon
my word of honor. You never knew me fail to
return any work you lent me." This we said rather
warmly, thinking we detected a somewhat suspicious
smile playing round the corner of our friend's
mouth. "Oh! yes, certainly," replied he; "you
can have it with pleasure&mdash;though I think your
doubts will vanish when you have <i>looked into it</i>."
We did not notice specially that all eyes were upon
us. We carelessly opened the volume, and there,
by all the spirits ever bought and sold! was a neat
little mirror between the covers of the book, and
reflected in it our own lovely countenance. Portrait
of the Gorilla! eh? This was what the boys
would call <i>rather rough</i>, but every one except ourself
seemed to think it quite funny. It was some
satisfaction, however, to know that every one of
the party had been taken in in like manner
before our arrival.</p>

<p>A slight but pleasant tinkling now fell upon our
ear, and behold! a maiden entered, bearing a tray
covered with tall crystal minarets, and transparent
goblets, which sparkled and twinkled in the lamplight,
followed by a more youthful figure supporting
vessels of porcelain and implements of burnished
silver, above which wreathed and curled clouds of
aromatic incense; or, in other and better words, two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hired girls brought in coffee and punch. Punch!
was it punch, or was it negus, or was it sherbet?
We don't know, but it was a pleasant, moderately
exhilarating beverage, compounded of whiskey, raspberry
syrup, sugar, and orange-flower water, and
manufactured by Nix, as he subsequently explained,
at a cost of about thirty cents per bottle. A few
little cakes and some plates of thin, daintily cut
slices of bread-and-butter accompanied the beverages,
and were handed round with them. We are
great believers in eating and drinking at all social
gatherings. It is convenient to have something to
do with your mouth when you are stumped in the
way of conversation. If suddenly asked a puzzling
question, or hit in the chest with a sarcasm, what a
resource is a glass of wine or cup of coffee, in which
to dip your nose whilst you collect your ideas, or
recover your breath. Besides, they give you something
to do, generally, in a small way. They afford
opportunities for small attentions, and excuses for
rising from your seat, or moving from one part of
the room to the other. Added to which, wine and
coffee and cakes are nice things to take&mdash;you have
the gratification of an additional sense. Then, too,
these little things are refreshing, and put you all in
good-humor. Therefore, for all these good reasons,
and many more, we insist on refreshments, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
insist, too, upon some kind of vinous stimulant;
this ice-water and doughnut business has been
carried altogether too far; had we less of it in
our homes, less money would pour into the coffers
of the bar-keeper. If persons are teetotallers, all
very well; we respect their opinions, and, perhaps,
decline their invitations; but for people who have
no moral scruples on the subject, to ask you to
visit them, and then insist on your drinking red-hot
weak green tea, when you are already nervous,
perspire readily, have a tender gullet, and
hate the confounded stuff any way, is downright
tyranny, and the very opposite of all hospitality
and true Christian charity. However, our friend
Nix held orthodox views on this question; so all
went well. By dint of helping each other to
things we did want, and offering each other things
we didn't want, with the aid of a cup of coffee for
those that liked coffee, and a glass of punch for
those who liked punch, not to forget the little
cakes, which came in quite handy to nibble at occasionally,
we all began to feel wonderfully at our
ease, and quite sociable. The conversation did
not flag much; but once when it showed a slight
tendency to wobble, Nix set it in motion again
by introducing the subject of optical illusions in
connexion with the height of objects. After inform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ing
us that a horse's head was exactly as long as
a flour-barrel, and that a common stove-pipe hat
was as broad across the crown as it was high
from the brim to the top (both of which statements
were argued pro and con), he drew our
attention to the vast difference the position of the
shoulders make in a man's height. This he illustrated
by walking from the audience with his
shoulders in their natural position, until, having
traversed half the length of the room, he suddenly
raised them, as represented in the accompanying
sketches. The effect was quite startling, and very
ludicrous. All the male part of the company tried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>their shoulders at this experiment, even down to
Freddy Nix, a little three-year-old, who, after ducking
his head down on his chest, and toddling off
across the room, returned swaggering, evidently
under the impression that he had made a perfect
giant of himself by the operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="480" height="484" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>This was nominally a child's party, so we were
to have some <i>performances</i>. The folding-doors
into the adjoining parlor were closed, and one or
two members of the company who were to
be performers retired. In a few moments the
doors opened and revealed an extempore stage.
The kitchen clothes-horse, beautifully draped and
decorated, formed the background; while on a
line with the foot-lights were two heads, one at
each side of the stage, intended to represent
Tragedy and Comedy. They were simply two large
pumpkins with grotesque faces marked on them
with black and white paint. In less than no time
a most remarkable-looking stranger stepped forward
and began to address us. Every one stared,
and wondered whence this singular-looking person
could have come, for we hardly supposed that Nix
could have had him secreted in the house all the
evening for our special surprise. At last it
dawned upon us, one by one, that the individual in
question was no other than Mr. Graham, a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>staid gentleman, who had been with us a moment
before. The annexed brace of sketches will show
the appearance of Mr. Graham off and on the stage.
But how was this change effected? We will
explain. In the first place he had procured a
narrow strip of black silk, which he had drawn
round one of his front teeth, with the two ends
inside his mouth, which, at a very short distance,
looked exactly as though he had lost one of his
teeth. (A little piece of court-plaster stuck on the
tooth will answer the same purpose.) Then he had
made a loop of horse-hair or grey thread, and securing
two of the ends to the lining inside his hat, had
hooked up the end of his nose with the other; in
fact, he had put his nose in a sling. This altered
the character of his whole face, so that his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
wife would not have known him had she not heard
him speak. He now addressed the audience in a
long, funny, showmanic rigmarole, of which we
only remember the following:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, you have all heard of
the Ornithorhyncus, which, as you are aware, is
a species of duck-billed Platypus. You are familiar
with the habits and appearance of the Ororo
Wow; and you have listened to the sweet notes
of the Catomonsterbung; but you are entirely ignorant
of the newly-discovered creature known to
scientific men as the Long-nosed Night-Howler, or
Vulgaris Pueris cum Papyrus Capitus. This extraordinary
animal is chiefly sugariverous in its diet,
though it will eat almost everything when driven
by hunger. It is perfectly tame, and will only
attack human beings when it feels like it. I will
now proceed to exhibit this extraordinary creature,
requesting you only not to run pins into the animal,
as it does not like that style of thing. Bring
in the Night-Howler!!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="640" height="450" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The last words were addressed in a loud voice to
an assistant outside, who immediately appeared,
leading an animal such as is represented in the
annexed cut. This monster began immediately to
emit the most hideous and unearthly noises, as
became the Night-Howler. After walking round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
among the audience once or twice, the Vulgaris
Pueris retired behind the curtain. The accompanying
sketch will explain how the Night-Howler
is made. Beyond the boy and the boots and the
brown-paper cap, all that is wanted is a rough
shawl or large fur cape. The howl is produced by
means of one or two instruments, into the construction
of which we will in a future chapter initiate
our readers. With one of these instruments the
most varied tones may be produced, from the grunt
of the hog to the most delicate notes of the canary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_034b.jpg" width="640" height="324" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The performance now proceeded: the second act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
being some feats of strength by one of our party
who had the necessary physical ability for that kind
of display. These embraced the following programme,
each feat being announced by Mr. Showman
with some extravagantly pompous title:</p>

<p>Balancing chair on chin.</p>

<p>Holding child three years old at arm's length.</p>

<p>Lying with the head on one chair and the heels
on another without any intermediate support, and
in this position allowing an apparently heavy but
really light trunk to be placed on his chest.</p>

<p>The whole wound up by his dancing a negro
breakdown to imitation banjo<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> on the piano, the
entire audience patting Juba.</p>

<p>Now another performer appeared on the stage,
dressed in extravagant imitation of the one who had
preceded him, and commenced parodying in a still
more extravagant style all the motions of the professional
acrobat. We expected something grand!
After innumerable flourishes he brought forward
a small three-pound dumb-bell, laid it on the floor,
and, bowing meekly to the audience in different
parts of the house, he stooped down as though
about to make an immense muscular effort, grasped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the dumb-bell, slowly stretched it forth at arm's
length, held it there a second or two, and then laid
it down again, made a little flourish with his hands,
and a low bow, just as they do in the circus after
achieving something extra fine. In this way the
performer went on burlesquing till we all roared
with laughter. When he had retired, a conjuror
appeared and exhibited numerous tricks, such as
the ring trick, tricks with hat and dice, cup and
ball, etc.; but as all these need machinery, we will
not describe them at present. One or two, however,
we may explain. No. 1. The performer presented
a pack of cards to one of the audience and
begged him to select a card; this the performer
then took in his own hand, and carried it with its
face downward, so that he could not see it, and
placed in the middle of the floor of the stage; he
then produced a large brown-paper cone, and
placed it over the card, and commenced talking to
the audience, telling them what he could do and
what he could not do: finally he informed the
audience that he could make that card pass to any
place he or they chose to name. Where would
they have it? One said one place, one another,
till finally he pretended reluctantly to accede to
one particularly importunate person's wishes, and
declared that it should be found in the leaves of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
certain book on a certain table at the back of the
audience&mdash;and there it was, sure enough. This was
done by having a piece of waxed paper attached to
a thread lying ready in the middle of the floor; on
this waxed paper the conjuror pressed the card,
the thread being carried out under the screen at
the back, where stood a confederate, who quietly
pulled the card out from under the cone, and while
the conjuror was talking he walked round, entered
by another door, and placed the card in the book,
where it was subsequently found.</p>

<p>Another trick consisted in his allowing a person
to draw a card which he was requested to examine
carefully, and even to mark slightly with a pencil.
While the spectator was doing this, the performer
turned round the pack in his hand so as to have all
the faces of the cards upwards except the top one,
which showed its back; he then desired that the
card might be slipped anywhere into the pack; he
then shuffled them well. Of course, on inspecting
the pack he soon detected the selected card, it
being the only one with its face down, which, after
various manipulations, putting under cones and
what not, he returned to the audience much to
their surprise.</p>

<p>These efforts at legerdemain were certainly not
very brilliant, but they amused the audience and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
were easy to do. We should like to give a few
more of his simple tricks, but with one illusion-trick
we will close the chapter, for which purpose
it will serve, as it formed the <i>finale</i> to the conjuror's
performance.</p>

<p>He stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"I have shown you many wonderful things, but
they are as nothing compared to what I can do.
My supernatural power is such that I can lengthen
or compress the human frame to any extent I please.
You doubt it? Well, I will show you. You see Mr.
Smith, yonder; he is a rather tall man; six feet two,
I should judge? Well, I will throw him into a
trance, and while he is in that state, I will squeeze
him down to a length of about three feet, and I will
have him carried to you in that condition. I must
only insist upon one thing, and that is, that you do
not say <i>hokey pokey winkey fumm</i> while he is in the
trance; for if you do it might wake him up, and
then he would be fixed at the height of three feet
for the rest of his life; I could never stretch him
out again."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was requested to step behind the
curtain. He walked forward, pale but firm and
collected. Soon after he had disappeared we heard
strange noises and fearful incantations, accompanied
by a slight smell of brimstone and a strong smell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of peppermint. After a few minutes the tall Mr.
Smith was carried in on the shoulders of two men
a perfect dwarf, as promised by the conjuror, and
as represented in the following cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="480" height="487" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>How this is managed will become tolerably clear
to the reader on examining the next diagram.</p>

<p>The tall Mr. S. had put a pair of boots on his
hands, a roll of sheeting round his neck, so as to
form something resembling a pillow, behind his
head; then something on his arms under his chin
to represent his chest (which is not shown in the
diagram), and over that a baby's cradle-quilt, and
then he rested his boots on another gentleman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
shoulders; two long sticks were provided and slung
as represented, and the miracle was complete. We
have seen the figure lengthened to an inordinate
extent by the same process, the only difference
being that the gentlemen were further apart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="580" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Nix's party concluded, after several other
games and amusements, with a neat but inexpensive
entertainment, consisting of sandwiches, sardines,
cold chicken, cakes, oranges, apples, nuts,
candies, punch, negus, and lemonade. But everything
was good of its kind; the sandwiches were
sandwiches, and not merely two huge slices of
bread plastered with butter, concealing an irregular
piece of sinew and fat, which in vain you try to
sever with your teeth, till you find yourself obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to drop the end out of your mouth, or else to pull
the whole piece of meat out from between the
bread, and allow it to hang on your chin till you
cram it all into your mouth at once. His were not
sandwiches of that kind, but, as we said before,
sandwiches; the cakes had plenty of sugar in them,
and so had the lemonade. But, above all, what
made these little trifles the most enjoyable was the
taste displayed by <i>some one</i> in the decoration of
the table with a few evergreens, some white roses
made out of turnip, and red roses out of beets, not
to mention marigolds that once were carrots, nor
the crisp frills of white paper which surrounded the
large round cakes, nor the green leaves under the
sandwiches, the abundance of snowy linen, shining
knives and forks, and spoons. But we must conclude;
what we wish particularly to impress upon
the minds of our readers by thus <i>dwelling on
sandwiches and fine linen</i> is, that you cannot
afford to ignore one sense while you propose to
gratify another; they are all intimately related
and bound together like members of a fire company;
if you offend one, all the others take
it up.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>In our last chapter we promised to explain the
nature of the little instrument by which the Night-Howler
produced those "hideous and unearthly
noises" to which we alluded. We will now proceed
to do so; and as this instrument is the same as
that used by showmen in the play of Punch and
Judy, we cannot do better, while we are about it,
than instruct our readers how to get up a Punch
and Judy show.</p>

<p>First, with regard to the instrument. It is a very
simple affair: get two small pieces of clean white
pine, and with a sharp knife cut them of the shape
and size of the diagram marked 1. Then put these
two pieces together as represented in Figure 2,
having previously slipped between them a piece of
common tape, also represented in the diagram
(the tape must be just the same width as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
wood); then wind some thread round the whole
thing lengthwise (to keep the bits of wood together
and the tape taut), and the Punch-trumpet
is made, as represented in figure 3. Place the
instrument between your lips and blow; if you
cannot produce noise enough to distract any well-regulated
family in three-quarters of an hour, we
are very much mistaken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="640" height="475" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>To produce variety of notes and tones, as well
as to speak through it, after the manner of the
Punch showmen, the instrument must be placed
well back in the mouth near the root of the tongue,
in such a position that you can blow through it and
at the same time retain free use of your tongue.
A little practice will enable you to do this, and to
pronounce many words in a tolerably understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>able
manner. To discover this last item in the
use of the instrument, simple as it is, cost the
writer of this an infinity of trouble and some
money; and it was not until after two years'
hunting and inquiry, and the employment of agents
to hunt up professors of Punch and Judy, that we
discovered an expert who, for a handsome fee, explained
the matter; and then, of course, we were
amazingly surprised that we had never thought of
it before. From the same expert we learned how
to make another instrument by means of which
it is possible to imitate the note of almost every
animal, from the hog to the canary-bird. We soon
compassed the hog, the horse, the hen, the dog, the
little pig, and something that might be called the
horse-linnet, or the hog-canary; but ere long we
found that considerable practice was necessary to
enable us to accomplish the finer notes of the singing-birds.
How to make this latter instrument we
will explain in a future chapter; at present we
must go on with the play of Punch and Judy.</p>

<p>We commence instructions with a view taken behind
the scenes, which will help the description
(see cut on page 40). We may state that the
London showmen carry about with them a species
of little theatre of simple construction, which is of
course better than a mere door-way; but as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>latter will answer the purpose, and many people
will not care to make a theatre, we will at present
content ourselves with that which every house
affords.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="460" height="800" alt="PUNCH AND JUDY, BEHIND THE SCENES." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">PUNCH AND JUDY, BEHIND THE SCENES.&mdash;<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_40">40</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>In the play of Punch and Judy there are many
characters&mdash;indeed, you can introduce almost as
great a variety as you please; but the leading ones
are:</p>

<p>Mr. Punch, a merry gentleman, of violent and
capricious temper.</p>

<p>Judy (wife of Punch).</p>

<p>Baby (offspring of Punch and Judy).</p>

<p>Ghost.</p>

<p>Constable.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_048a.jpg" width="640" height="378" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_048b.jpg" width="210" height="448" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The heads of these characters can be made in several
ways. The first is to get the necessary number
of common round wooden lucifer match-boxes and
some red putty. With the putty you make the
noses and chins of the characters (all except the
Ghost, who requires no nose). With a camel's-hair
brush and a little India-ink or black paint you
mark out the features strongly, taking care to make
the eyes and eyeballs of a good size, so as to be seen
at a distance. With a little red paint or red chalk
you can color the cheeks, and with a little white
paint or white chalk give brilliancy to the teeth
and eyes. The annexed cut will show what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
style of countenance ought to be of each, No. 1
being the Constable, No. 2 Judy, and No. 3 Mr.
Punch himself. The Ghost is not represented.
In feature he is much like the Constable, only that
his face must be made as white as possible, and
the features simply marked out in blue or green or
black. The Baby can be made out of an ordinary
clothes-pin or stick of wood.</p>

<p>If the match-boxes cannot be easily obtained,
just roll up a good-sized card, as represented
in this figure, and paint on it the
features. The nose and chin can be
made of a bit of red rag or paper folded
up of the desired shape, and either
sewed or gummed on. Another and
far better way of making these heads
(though it takes more trouble), is to get
a carpenter to cut out for you four or five pieces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>of white pine or other fine wood of the shape of
the sketch annexed, with a hole in each large
enough to easily admit your fore-finger. From this
block you can carve as elaborate a head as you
please, and one of larger size than the match-box,
which will be advantageous. The diagram marked O
will show you how to set about making the carving.
Having now made the bald heads, you must proceed
to dress them. Punch must have a bright
red cap with yellow tassel and binding, like the one
in the accompanying sketch. Judy must have a
white cap with broad frill and black ribbon. The
Constable must have a wig made out of some scrap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of fur (the remains of a tippet or cuff), or if fur
cannot be procured, a piece of rope unravelled will
make a good wig. The Ghost only requires his
winding-sheet drawn over his head. All these can
be nailed on the heads of the actors with small
tacks without hurting their feelings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_049b.jpg" width="640" height="228" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Having got the heads complete, we will proceed
to construct their bodies. These merely consist of
empty garments, the operator's hand supplying the
bone and sinew. The dresses must be neatly fastened
round the neck of the head, so that when the
performer puts his hand inside the dress, he can
thrust his fore-finger into the hole in the head.
They must of course be sufficiently large to admit
the hand of the showman, each sleeve to admit a
thumb or finger, and the neck large enough for
the passage of the fore-finger. Thus the thumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
represents one arm, the middle finger another
arm, whilst the fore-finger, thrust into the head,
supports and moves it about. The style of dress
of Punch and Judy can be easily seen in the small
sketch. The color of Punch's coat should be red,
with yellow facings, with a hump sewed on his
back and a paunch in front. Judy should have a
spotted calico and white neck-handkerchief. The
Constable had better be attired in black, and the
Ghost and Baby in white. Each of the sleeves
should have a hand fastened into it. The hands
can be made of little slips of wood, with fingers and
thumbs marked on them. They should be about two
and a half or three inches long, only about three-quarters
of an inch of which, however, will project
beyond the sleeve; the rest, being
inside, will serve to give stiffness
to the arm when the performer's
fingers are not long enough to
reach the whole way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="241" height="448" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Punch requires a club wherewith
to beat his wife, and to perform
his various other assaults and
batteries. A gallows, too, should
be provided, on the plan represented
in the diagram, the use of which will be explained
hereafter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>.</p>

<p>So much for the performers. Now for the theatre
and the play. The theatre is easily made. A
narrow board about three or four inches wide
should be fixed across an open doorway just about
one inch higher up than the top of the head of the
exhibitor. From this board hangs a curtain long
enough to reach the floor. Behind this curtain
stands the operator, with his actors all ready on a
chair or table at his side. He puts his Punch-trumpet
in his mouth, gives one or two preliminary
<i>root-et-too-teet-toos</i>, puts his hand fairly inside Mr.
Punch's body, and hoists him up so that half his
manly form may be seen above the screen. A
glance at our picture, <span class="smcap">Behind the Scenes</span>, will
explain anything our words have failed to convey.
The audience are of course on the opposite side of
the curtain to which the performer stands.</p>

<p>Before we commence with the dialogue of the
play, we must mention one very important part of
the exhibition. As Mr. Punch's voice is, at the
best of times, rather husky, it is necessary that the
exhibitor should have a colleague or interpreter
among the audience who knows the play by heart,
and who, from practice, can understand what Mr.
Punch says better than the audience. This person
must repeat after Punch whatever he may say, only
not to wound his feelings; he must do so in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
form of questions&mdash;for example, suppose Mr. Punch
says, "Oh! I've got such a pretty baby!" the showman
outside must repeat: "Oh! you've got a pretty
baby, Mr. Punch, have you? Where is she?"
The outside showman ought to have some instrument
to play on&mdash;a tin tea-tray or tin pan will do&mdash;and
if there is any one to accompany him on the
piano when Mr. Punch sings a song or dances, so
much the better. Now for the play.</p>

<p>Mr. Punch makes his <i>d&eacute;but</i> by dancing round his
small stage in an extravagant and insane manner,
singing some rollicking song in his own peculiar
style. Having indulged himself in this way for a
few seconds, he pulls up suddenly, and looking over
the edge of the screen at the showman outside, exclaims:</p>

<p><i>Punch.</i> "I say, old hoss!"</p>

<p><i>Showman.</i> "I say, 'old hoss!' Mr. Punch, that's
not a very polite way to address a gentleman.
Well, what do you say?"</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "I say!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Well, what do you say?"</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "I say!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Well, you've said 'I say!' twice before.
What is it you have to say?"</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "I say!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "What?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>P.</i> "Nothing particular!"</p>

<p>Mr. Punch dances off, hilariously singing.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Nothing particular! Well, that is a valuable
communication."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> (Stopping again). "Oh, you April fool!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "April fool? No, Mr. Punch, I'm not an
April fool. This isn't the first of April."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "Isn't it? Well, salt it down till next year."</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Salt it down till next year? No, thankee,
Mr. Punch. Guess you'll want it for your own
use."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "Mr. Showman!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Well, Mr. Punch?"</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "Have you seen my wife?"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Seen your wife? No, Mr. Punch."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "She's such a pretty creature!"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Such a pretty creature, eh? Well, I'd like
to be introduced."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "She's such a beauty! She's got a nose just
like mine" (touching his snout with his little
hand).</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Got a nose just like yours, eh? Well, then,
she must be a beauty."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "She's not quite so beautiful as me, though."</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Not so beautiful as you? No, of course not,
Mr. Punch; we couldn't expect that."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "You're a very nice man. I like you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Well, I'm glad you like me, Mr. Punch."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "Shall I call my wife?"</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Yes, by all means call your wife, Mr.
Punch."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> (Calling loudly). "Judy! Judy, my dear!
Judy! come up-stairs!"</p>

<p>Judy now makes her appearance. Punch draws
back and stands gazing at her for a few minutes in
mute admiration. Without moving, he exclaims:
"What a beauty!" then, turning to the audience,
he asks earnestly: "Isn't she a beauty?" He now
turns to Judy and asks her for a kiss; they approach
and hug each other in a prolonged embrace,
Mr. Punch all the time emitting a species of gurgling
sound expressive of rapture. This is repeated
several times, interspersed with the remarks
of Mr. Punch on the beauty of his spouse;
after which, at Mr. <i>P.</i>'s suggestion, the couple
dance together to lively music and the enlivening
tones of Mr. <i>P.</i>'s voice; the performance winding
up by Mr. Punch's leaning up against the door of
the theatre exhausted and delighted, and giving
vent to a prolonged chuckle of gratification.</p>

<p>Punch now turns to the Showman and asks him
if he has ever seen his Baby. The Showman replying
in the negative, Punch extols the beauty of
his offspring in the same extravagant strain as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
has already done that of his wife, makes the same
comparison between his own and the Baby's nose,
declares that the Baby never cries, and that she is
"<i>so fond of him</i>."</p>

<p>The Baby is now ordered to be brought up-stairs,
and Judy disappears to obey her lord's mandate.
During her absence Punch favors the company
with a song. When Judy returns, bearing
the infant Punch in her arms, Mr. P. goes into raptures,
calls it a pretty creature, pats its cheek, and
goes through all the little endearing ceremonies
common to fathers. After again informing the
Showman that his Baby never cries, and is fondly
attached to him, he takes the infant in his arms,
whereupon she immediately sets up a continuous
howl. Punch tries to hush and pacify it for some
time, but at last, losing his temper, shakes it violently
and throws it out of the window, or in
other words, at the feet of the audience. Judy is
of course distracted, weeps bitterly, and upbraids
her husband, when the enraged Mr. Punch dives
down-stairs and gets his club, and whilst Mrs. P. is
still weeping, gives her three or four sound blows
on the back of the head. This makes Mrs. P. cry
still more, which, in turn, increases Mr. P.'s wrath,
who ends by beating her to death and throwing
her after the Baby. The Showman upbraids Punch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
with his crime, but Punch defends himself by saying
it served her right. However, he finally admits
that he is naturally a little hasty, but then he adds,
"It's over in a minute," and that's the kind of disposition
he likes. He further adds:</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "I'm a proud, sensitive nature."</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "You're a proud, sensitive nature, are you,
Mr. Punch? I don't see much pride in killing a
baby."</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "That's because you don't understand the
feelings of a gentleman."</p>

<p><i>S.</i> "Because I don't understand the feelings of a
gentleman? Well, if those are the feelings of a
gentleman, I don't want to understand them, Mr.
Punch."</p>

<p>This dialogue can be carried on to suit the taste
and invention of the exhibitor.</p>

<p>Presently, while Mr. P. is recklessly glorying in
his crime, declaring that he is afraid of nothing,
and laughing to scorn the Showman's admonition,
the Ghost makes his appearance close to Mr. <i>P.</i>'s
shoulder, and stands there for some time, listening
unobserved to Punch's brag. After a while, however,
turning round, Punch catches sight of him,
and is rooted to the spot with horror for a few seconds;
then he retreats backwards, his whole body
trembling violently, till he reaches the side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
theatre; here he turns round slowly to hide his
face from the awful apparition. When, by turning
away, he loses sight of the Ghost for a few
seconds, he recovers his voice so far as to say to
the Showman in trembling tones: "W-h-h-a-a-t a
hor-r-r-rid creature! What an awful creature!"
Then he turns round very slowly to see whether
the "horrid creature" is gone, but finding it still
there, suddenly jumps back&mdash;jambs himself up in
the corner&mdash;pokes his head out of the window, and
screams, "Murder! murder! murder!" shaking all
the time violently. This he repeats several times,
till at last the Ghost disappears. Then Mr. P. recovers
his courage and swaggers about as before,
vowing he is afraid of nothing, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Now appears on the stage the Constable, who
twists himself about in a pompous style for some
seconds, and then addressing Mr. Punch, says:</p>

<p><i>Constable.</i> "I've come to take you up!"</p>

<p><i>P.</i> "And I've come to knock you down!" (which
he accordingly does with his club).</p>

<p>The Constable gets up, and is again knocked
down several times in succession. Not relishing
this style of thing, however, he disappears and returns
with a club, and a battle royal ensues, part of
which&mdash;that is to say, one round of the battle&mdash;shows
the skill of the Constable in dodging Mr. P.'s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
blows, and can be made immensely funny if properly
performed. It is done in this way: The Constable
stands perfectly still, and Punch takes deliberate
aim; but when he strikes, the Constable
bobs down quickly, and the blow passes harmlessly
over his head. This is repeated frequently, the
Constable every now and then retaliating on Mr.
P.'s "nob" with effect. Not succeeding with the
sabre-cut, Punch tries the straight or rapier thrust.
He points the end of his <i>baton</i> straight at the Constable's
nose, and after drawing back two or three
times to be sure of his aim, makes a lunge; but
the Constable is too quick, dodges on one side, and
Punch's club passes innocently out of the window.
This is repeated several times, till the Constable
sails in and gives Punch a whack on the head, crying:
"There's a topper!" Punch returns the compliment
with the remark: "There's a whopper!"
Now they have a regular rough and tumble, in
which Punch is vanquished.</p>

<p>The Constable disappears and returns with the
gallows, which he sticks up in a hole already made
in the stage (four-inch board previously mentioned),
and proceeds to prepare for the awful ceremony of
hanging Mr. P. Punch, never having been hung
before, cannot make out how the machine is intended
to operate&mdash;at least he feigns profound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ignorance on the subject. When the Constable
tells him to put his head into the noose, he puts it in
the wrong place over and over again, inquiring each
time, "That way?" till at last the executioner,
losing all patience, puts his own head in the loop,
in order to show Mr. P. how to do it, saying:
"There! that's the way! Now do you understand?"
To which Punch responds, "Oh! that's
the way, is it?" at the same time pulling the end
of the rope tight, and holding on to it till the
struggling functionary is dead, crying all the time:
"Oh! that's the way, is it? Now I understand!"</p>

<p>Punch dances a triumphant jig, and so ends the
<i>immoral</i> drama of Punch and Judy.</p>

<p>Many more characters can be added at the option
of the performer, besides which, jokes and riddles
can be introduced to any extent. We have given
the skeleton of the play, with all the necessary information
for getting up the characters.</p>

<p>We will conclude this chapter with an excellent
charade, the answer to which will be given in the
next chapter:</p>

<p class="noidt">Heretofore
the fireside
amusements
recorded by
us have been
rather masculine
in their
character. In
this chapter
we shall have
the pleasure of describing an entertainment
of more feminine qualities.
It was a small party, of the description
which the Scotch call a cookeyshine, the
English a tea-fight, and we a sociable. A few
young ladies in a country village had conspired
together to pass a pleasant evening, and the head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
conspirator wrote us a note, which consisted of
several rows of very neat snake-rail fences (not "rail
snake" fences, as the Irishman said), running across
a pink field. We got over the fences easily, and
found ourselves in a pretty parlor, with six pretty
young ladies, one elderly ditto, and a kind of father.
The ladies, as we entered, were engaged in making
tasty little scent-bags. We had often seen the kind
of thing before, but never so completely carried out.</p>

<p>The principal idea consisted in making miniature
mice out of apple-seeds, nibbling at a miniature
sack of flour. But in this case they had filled the
sack with powdered orris-root, and the small bottles
with otto of roses, making altogether a very fragrant
little ornament. The subjoined sketch will
convey the idea to any one wishing to try her
hand at this kind of art.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the process of manufacture, that is simple
enough: you first make neat little bags of white
muslin, and with some blue paint (water color)
mark the name of the perfume, in imitation of the
ordinary brands on flour-bags; then fill the bag
with sachet-powder and tie it up. You then get
some well-formed apple-seeds, and a needle filled
with brown thread or silk with a knot at the end;
after which pass the needle through one side
of the small end of the seed, and out through the
middle of the big end; then cut off your thread,
leaving about half an inch projecting from the
seed; this represents the tail of the mouse. After
this you make another knot in your thread, and
pass it through the opposite side of the small end
of the seed, bringing it out, not where you did the
other thread, but in the middle of the lower part,
that part, in fact, which represents the stomach of
the mouse. You can now sew your mouse on the
flour-sack. It should be borne in mind that the
two knots of thread, which represent the ears,
must appear near the small end of the seed. We
once saw some mice made of apple-seeds where the
ears were placed at the big end, producing the
most ridiculous effect. We annex enlarged diagrams
of each style.</p>

<p>It will be seen that one looks like a mouse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
whilst the other resembles a pollywog, or a newly-hatched
dragon.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="640" height="420" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>You must now get a good-sized card, and if you
wish to have it <i>very nice</i>, paint it to resemble the
boards of a floor. On this you sew your sack, and
one or two stray mice who are supposed to be running
round loose. Then having provided yourself
with a couple of those delicate little glass bottles of
about an inch and a half in length, which are to be
found in most toy-stores, you fill them with otto of
roses or any other perfume; and with a little strong
glue or gum, stick them to the card in the position
represented. If glass bottles are not to be obtained,
you may cut some out of wood, a small willow stick
perhaps being the best for the purpose; blacken
them with ink, and varnish them with weak gum-water,
at the same time sticking on them little pieces
of paper to represent the labels, and, if you please,
a little lead-paper round the neck and mouth of the
bottles, to give the flasks a champagney flavor.
The boxes and jars are likewise cut out of wood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and easily painted to produce the desired appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="640" height="228" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>After a time, while the young ladies were still at
work on the mice like so many kittens at play, a
practical young gentleman, in spectacles and livid
hands, came in, and asked <i>of what use were those
articles</i>. Upon which one of the young ladies very
properly replied that they did not waste their time
in making anything <i>useful</i>. This seemed to afford
an opportunity to the young gentleman to say something
agreeable in connection with <i>beauty</i>; but he
put his foot in it, and we heard him late in the
evening, as the party was breaking up, trying to
explain his compliment, which, though well intended,
had unfortunately taken the form of an insult,
and had not been well received.</p>

<p>We had observed, on entering, that one of the
young ladies present wore in her hair a very beautiful
white rose, and that another held in her hand a
small bunch of marigolds. As the season was mid-winter,
this fact attracted our attention, and we very
gracefully complimented said damsel on the beauty
of her <i>coiffure</i>, at the same time expressing our
ardent admiration for flowers generally, roses particularly,
and white roses above all other roses.
"We had made a study of them." We spoke rapturously
of them as the poetry of vegetation, as <i>ves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>tals
among flowers, as the emblems of purity, the
incarnation of innocence</i>. Then the young lady
asked us how we liked them <i>boiled</i>, and taking the
one from her head begged us to wear it next our
heart for her sake. We received it reverentially at
her hand&mdash;it was heavy as lead. Her somewhat
ambiguous language immediately explained itself as
she gaily stripped off the leaves and revealed a
good-sized turnip-stock on a wooden skewer. We
felt slightly embarrassed, but got over the difficulty
by saying that when we spoke so poetically we had
no idea what would turn-up.</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed one of the young ladies, "it is the
way of the world; the flower worshipped from afar,
possessed, will ever turn out a turnip!"</p>

<p>"Or," added we, "as in the case of Cinderella's
humble vegetable turn up, a turnout."</p>

<p>This inoffensive little joke, being rather far-fetched,
perhaps, was immediately set upon and
almost belabored to death by those who understood
it; whilst for the enlightenment of those who did
not, we had to travel all the way to fairy-land, so
that it was some time before we got back to vegetable
flowers&mdash;a subject on which we felt not a little
anxious to be enlightened, as we saw therein something
that might interest our friends who meet by
the fireside and help us in our occupation of un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>bending
the bow. Marvellously simple were the
means employed in producing such beautiful results.
A white turnip neatly peeled, notched all round,
stuck upon a skewer, and surrounded by a few
green leaves, and behold a most exquisite white
rose, perfect enough to deceive the eye in broad
daylight at three feet distance. The above sketch
will explain the whole mystery at once.</p>

<p>On the same principle a marigold may be cut out
of a round of carrot with a little button of beet-root
for the centre; a daisy can be made from a round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of parsnip with a small button of carrot for the centre;
a dahlia from a beet; and several other flowers
from pumpkins. It will be easily seen that a beautiful
bouquet can be compiled of these flowers
with the addition of a few sprigs of evergreen. Indeed,
great taste and ingenuity may be displayed in
managing these simple materials. When the process
had been explained to us, as above described,
we expressed our delight, at the same time saying
carelessly that there were doubtless millions of
ladies in the country who would find pleasure in
learning so graceful an accomplishment. The gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tleman
with the gold spectacles was down upon us
in a moment.</p>

<p>"Did we know what a million meant?"</p>

<p>To which we promptly replied that a million
meant ten hundred thousand.</p>

<p>"Did we know what a billion meant?"</p>

<p>A billion, according to Webster, was a million
million.</p>

<p>A light twinkled out of the gold spectacles, and a
glow suffused the expansive forehead, as, with a
certain playful severity, he propounded the following:</p>

<p>"How long would it take you to count a million
million, supposing you counted at the rate of two
hundred per minute for twenty-four hours per
day?"</p>

<p>We replied, after a little reflection, that it would
take a long time, probably over six months.</p>

<p>With a triumphant air, the gold spectacles turned
to our friend Nix. Nix, who is a pretty good accountant,
thought it would take nearer six years
than six months. One young lady, who was not
good at figures, felt sure <i>she</i> could do it in a week.
Gold Spectacles exhibited that intense satisfaction
which the mathematical mind experiences when it
has completely obfuscated the ordinary understanding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, sir," he said, turning to us, "had you been
born on the same day as Adam, and had you been
counting ever since, night and day, without stopping
to eat, drink, or sleep, you would not have more
than accomplished half your task."</p>

<p>This statement was received with a murmur of
incredulous derision, whilst two or three financial
gentlemen, immediately seizing pen and paper, began
figuring it out, with the following result:</p>



<div class='center'>

</table></div>

<p class="noidt">So that it would take nine thousand five hundred
and twelve years, not to mention several months, to
count a billion. Gold Spectacles chuckled visibly,
and for the rest of the evening gave himself
airs more worthy of a conquered Southerner than a
victorious mathematician. He afterwards swooped
down upon and completely doubled up a pompous
gentleman bearing the cheerful name of Peter
Coffin, for making use of the very proper phrase,
"As clear as a mathematical demonstration."</p>

<p>"That may not be very clear, after all, Mr.
Coffin," said Gold Spectacles.</p>

<p>"How is that, Mr. Sprawl (Gold Specks' proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
name being Sprawl); can anything be clearer than
a mathematical demonstration?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir," answered Mr. Sprawl, "I could
<i>mathematically demonstrate</i> to you that one is equal
to two. What would you think of that, sir?"</p>

<p>"I think you couldn't do it, sir."</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Sprawl took a sheet of paper and
wrote down the following equation&mdash;the celebrated
algebraic paradox:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>a</i> = <i>x</i><br />
<i>a x</i> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup><br />
<i>a x</i> - <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>a</i><sup>2</sup><br />
(<i>x</i> - <i>a</i>) &times; <i>a</i> = (<i>x</i> - <i>a</i>) &times; (<i>x</i> + <i>a</i>)<br />
<i>a</i> = <i>x</i> + <i>a</i><br />
<i>a</i> = <i>2 a</i><br />
1 = 2<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Coffin examined it carefully standing up, and
examined it carefully sitting down, and then handed
it back, saying that Mr. Sprawl had certainly proved
one to be equal to two. The paper was passed
round, and those learned enough scrutinized it carefully.
The <i>demonstration</i> all allowed to be positive,
yet no one could be made to admit the <i>fact</i>.</p>

<p>Here a certain married lady avowed her great
delight in knowing that <i>one</i> had at last been <i>proved</i>
equal to <i>two</i>. She had been for years, she said, try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ing
to convince her husband of this fact, but he
always obstinately refused to listen to the voice of
reason. She now trusted he would not have the
effrontery to fly in the face of an <i>algebraic paradox</i>.</p>

<p>Seeing the talk had taken an arithmetical turn, and
was moreover getting fearfully abstruse, our friend
Nix thought he would gently lead the tide of conversation
into some shallower channel, wherein the
young ladies might dabble their pretty feet without
danger of being swept away in the scientific torrent.
To this end he submitted the well known
problem: "What is the difference between six dozen
dozen and half a dozen dozen?" Strange to say,
no one present had ever before heard of it, but the
best part of the joke consisted in Mr. Sprawl being
completely taken by it.</p>

<p>"Why, they are both the same," he answered
promptly.</p>

<p>All the rest seemed to think so too, and some
could not get into their heads, although poor Nix
spent half an hour trying to convince them, that
half a dozen dozen was the same thing as six dozen,
or 72; whilst six dozen dozen must of course be
seventy-two dozen, or 864.</p>

<p>While Nix still spoke, a handmaiden appeared,
bearing tinkling cups and vessels of aromatic tea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
(not the weak green kind, bear in mind), and plates
of sweet cookies and toast, and then bread and butter,
and steaming waffles, and divers and sundry
other delicacies known to true housewives and good
Christian women, who love their fellow-creatures
and respect their organs of digestion.</p>

<p>As the tea is being served, we walk up to a young
gentleman and ask him if he knows why the blind
man was restored to sight when he drank tea. The
young gentleman <i>gave it up</i> precipitately.</p>

<p>"Because he took his cup and saucer (saw sir)."</p>

<p>The gentleman in gold spectacles says something
about our being a <i>sorcerer</i>, but we heed him not,
fearing he may put us through another algebraic
paradox. Then comes a general demand for the
answer to the charade we published in our last
chapter, which commenced:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My whole is the name of a school-boy's dread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The answer to this, ladies, is Rattan; and you
will find it," said we, "a most excellent charade for
children."</p>

<p>Now commenced a grand festival of puzzles and
riddles. Specimens of all kinds were trotted out
for inspection, from the ponderous construction of
our ancestors, commencing in some such style as,
"All round the house, through the house, and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
touching the house," etc., to the neatly turned modern
con.</p>

<p>Our friend Nix asked why Moses and the Jews
were the best-bred people in the world?</p>

<p>Another wished to know why meat should always
be served rare?</p>

<p>Both these individuals, however, refused to give
the solution until the next meeting of the assembled
company. Others were more obliging, but as their
riddles were mostly old friends, somebody knew
the answers and revealed them. It is a mistake to
suppose that a good thing ought not to be repeated
more than once. There are certain funny things
that we remember for the last twenty years, and yet
we never recall them without enjoying a hearty
laugh. We have read Holmes's <i>Autocrat of the
Breakfast-Table</i> once every six months, ever since
it was published, and enjoy it better each time.
We have been working away at the <i>Sparrowgrass
Papers</i> for years, and yet we raise just as good a
crop of laughter from them as ever. These books
resemble some of our rich Western lands: they are
inexhaustible. So when one of the company asked,
"When does a sculptor die of a fit?" we waited
quietly for the answer, "When he makes faces and
busts," and laughed as heartily as though it were
quite new, although we had been intimate with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
old con ever since it was made, some fifteen years
ago. We even enjoyed the time-honored riddle:
"What was Joan of Arc made of?" "Why, she was
Maid of Orleans, of course." But then this was put
by a seraph with amber eyes, and a very bewildering
way of using them. The success attending this
effort seemed to stimulate the gentleman in gold
spectacles, who rushed into the arena with the inquiry:
"What was Eve made for?" Most of us
knew the answer well enough, but we waited politely
to let him deliver it himself. Our surprise may
be readily conceived when he informed us, with evident
glee, that "she was made for Harnden's Express
Company." Some looked blank, and others
tittered, whilst Nix explained to the ladies the true
solution. It was for Adam's Express Company
that Eve was made. After this followed in quick
succession a shower of riddles, some of them so
abominably bad, that an old gentleman, who did not
seem to take kindly to that sort of amusement, gave
the finishing-stroke to the entertainment by the
annexed:</p>

<p>Question. "Why is an apple-tart like a slipper?"</p>

<p>Answer. "Because you can put your foot in it&mdash;if you like."</p>

<p>After that we all went home.</p>



<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>A friend of ours, Dudley Wegger, who recently
gave an extemporaneous entertainment, amongst
other things, devised a new kind of play, of such
exceedingly simple construction that we have
judged it expedient to put it on record. It must
be observed that it is his <i>method</i> especially which
we applaud and recommend, and further be it observed,
that we applaud and recommend it on account
of no other excellence save that of simplicity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wegger possessed the power of imitating
one or two popular actors. He had read our instructions
on <i>make-up</i>&mdash;viz.: curled hair, turn-up
nose, high shoulders, etc., and from these slender
materials he made the body of his play. As soon
as we arrived, he seized upon ourself, dragged us
into a back room, put a hideous mask on our face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
(which smelt painfully of glue and brown paper, by
the way), and then commanded us to don sundry
articles of female attire&mdash;to wit, a hat and gown.
To our earnest appeals as to what we were to do,
he only replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; just come on the stage, kick
about, and answer my questions. You hold the
stage and talk to the audience, whilst I go off and
change my dress."</p>

<p>This we pledged ourself to do, and were nearly
suffocated in the mask as a consequence.</p>

<p>When the curtain rose, Wegger marched on the
stage attired in blue coat, brass buttons, striped
pantaloons, yellow vest, and stylish hat stuck on
one side. In his hand he held a small walking-cane,
with which he frequently slapped his leg.
This was the walking-gentleman part.</p>

<p>"Egad! here I am at last, after the fastest run
across country on record. Slipped the Billies, took
flying hollow at a leap, gave my admirable aunt the
go-by, extracted the governor's lynch-pin, sent
them all sprawling in the ditch, just in time to be
picked up by old Hodge, the carrier, jogging along
with his blind mare and rumbling old shandrydan.

<p><i>Adolphus.</i> "Fact! Hembold's Cosmos cured me
immediately, if not sooner. Oh, yes! I'm all right,
thank ye. But excuse me, young woman. I've
come down here on a little matter of business of
the highest importance. Your name is Lady Cicily
Rhino?"</p>

<p><i>Lady C.</i> "Wal, 'taint nothin' else."</p>

<p><i>Adolphus.</i> "That is precisely what I want to arrive
at. I am in the dry-goods business, than which
there is no higher social position in the world. I
am not rich, but I expect to be. Of my personal
appearance you can form a more just and adequate
opinion than any language of mine could convey.
In other words, I am more easily conceived than described.
Now, the question is, whether you will accept
my hand and heart."</p>

<p><i>Lady C.</i> "Wal, I don't keer if I do."</p>

<p><i>Adolphus.</i> "Most charming little pippetsy poppetsy;
let me embrace those virgin lips."</p>

<p><i>Lady C.</i> "Oh, lor! Now wait a minute." (Turns
her head away bashfully, and puts up her umbrella.
Both parties retire behind the umbrella, when a loud
smack is heard&mdash;such a smack as has been compared
to the noise produced by a horse dragging his foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
out of a mud-hole. Then both strike an attitude
with the umbrella between them, and the curtain
descends in a blaze of red light.)</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now if this is not a simple way of building a
drama, we are no judge.</p>

<p>Our adjoining illustration represents the interview
between General Hab-grabemall and the lady.
The General acquires a gigantic appearance by
tying a folded shawl or small pillow on each shoulder
before he puts on his cloak; his face is made up
chiefly of curled hair and diachylon. Reginald
Spooneigh has long flaxen hair, made out of some
rope unravelled for the purpose, and sewed on to a
tightly-fitting cap, moustache and beard to match,
and turn-down collar. The rest of his attire may
be in any style most convenient.</p>

<p>Mr. Tinkletop is remarkable for a red nose,
turned up, and one tooth missing (both according
to our prescription given in a previous chapter).
His vest and cravat are of bright colors, and his
coat also, if possible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Mankind in general, and we modern Americans
in particular, are perpetually striving to come a
"gouge game" over nature. We feel that this expression
is very slangy and low-lived, but as none
other seems so precisely to convey our idea, we must
for once borrow a phrase from the ring and the race-course.
So we repeat that we are, most of us, perpetually
striving to "gouge" nature; but nature is
too smart for us, and will not allow herself to be fooled
by any clumsy device it is in our power to invent.
Nature starts us in the business of life with a certain
amount of capital in mental, physical, and nervous
power; and just so much capacity for enjoyment;
and we, instead of investing this in the best
manner to produce the largest legitimate amount of
interest, are perpetually engaged in trying some
"dodge" whereby we may spend the capital and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
still draw the interest. A young man starts in business
with the resolution that he will make a fortune
in such and such a number of years, and then he
will retire while he is still young, and lead the most
glorious life mortal ever knew. And so he <i>pitches
in</i>, buys, sells, wheedles, bullies, tricks, cheats, works
night and day, without any let-up at all. There will
be plenty of time, he thinks, for recreation when he has
made his fortune. Then he will go to Europe, build
himself a house on the Hudson, buy the fastest pair
of horses, cultivate society, purchase pictures, and
be supremely happy. The years trot on, but the
hopeful man finds it is slower work making a <i>pile</i> than
he thought; or perhaps he raises his figure, so he
sets to work with renewed vigor. His nerves are
allowed no rest to recover their tone; his stomach
is allowed no leisure to perform its work; his body
gets no healthful exercise; and his soul no ray of
light from the beautiful and lovable. "There will
be time for all these things by and by, when he has
made that two hundred thousand dollars." At last
the sum is made, though our hopeful man is a
few years older than he intended he should be on
retiring. Still the money is made, and he is going
to enjoy it. He builds himself a fine house in the
country, with "lots of style into it," and plants
around it a number of small trees, which will be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
decent size about twenty years after he is buried.
But that is of no consequence&mdash;there is beautiful
scenery all around. But what is this the rich man
discovers? Why, that the trees and hills and streams
are not the same that they were when he was young.
He finds, too, that pictures "don't amount to much."
He is rather nervous about driving fast horses; and
as to society, he has got quite out of the way of that
whilst making his fortune. He finds that collecting
round one congenial and agreeable people is a work
of time and care, besides which, there is no society
in the country any way. Then his wife hates the
country. So our rich man sells his house in the
country, returns to the city, and enters into some
new business operations just to pass the time away;
having made the melancholy discovery that whilst
engaged in acquiring means, he has lost the capacity
for enjoyment. The fact is, nature will not stand
much nonsense. If you think you are going to
work her without mercy or consideration the best
part of your life, and then expect that she will gaily
bear you on her back, sporting through valleys of
delight, you are very much mistaken.</p>

<p>Another man thinks he will get the maximum
enjoyment out of life by aid of wine, and so he
mortgages his whole capacity of enjoyment for a
few years' excessive excitement, and is amazingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
surprised when he finds himself a bankrupt. Nature
will not cash his draft at any price. He is not
aware that every thrill of pleasure derived from excessive
stimulating has to be paid for with usury.
Others again fancy they will get ahead of nature by
forcing the minds of their children as they would
cucumbers; but after an incalculable amount of
trouble, expense, and cruelty, the child comes of age
a bankrupt, mentally and physically. The soil has
run out; it can produce no more&mdash;and what wonder!
It was never allowed to lie fallow; it was
never renewed; and now it is fit for little or nothing.</p>

<p>These are some of the ways in which we attempt
to <i>gouge</i> nature. We overtax her in every way,
until we <i>drive the willing horse to death</i>, and then
our journey ends; all the load of fine goods we
have been to market for, must be dumped into the
mud for the next traveller coming along with a fresh
horse.</p>

<p>Now, one great aim of this book on "Fireside
Amusements," is to persuade people to let up on
nature. We should all be so much healthier, so
much kinder, so much better Christians, if we would
only amuse ourselves and each other a good deal
more. We should get such infinitely better work
out of ourselves, and more of it, so that we should
be richer into the bargain. No man can expect to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
win the race with a jaded horse. Suppose you
owned Flora Temple, and in your eagerness to
make money, should oblige her to run two or three
races every day; why, the chances are you would
lose every time, and soon be a beggar. But suppose
you only match her at proper intervals, when she is
fresh and in good condition; you don't run so many
races, but you win every time. Why should you
treat yourself so much worse than a horse? Is it
because you are &mdash;&mdash;? No, you have simply
adopted a bad national custom.</p>

<h4>AUNTY DELLUVIAN GIVES A PARTY.</h4>

<p>We have a female relative whom we have playfully
christened Aunty Delluvian&mdash;an old-fashioned
person, who is particularly opposed to all "new-fangled
notions," who loves the "good old times" and
"good old ways;" who thinks there are no young
men nowadays to compare with those of her day.
She tells how straight they used to carry themselves,
and she draws herself bolt upright and
throws back her shoulders to give effect to her
words, and "they didn't wear those nasty things&mdash;pshaw!&mdash;over
their lips." She has never become
reconciled to moustaches. She thinks, too, the girls
are not so pretty nowadays as they used to be;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
then, their cheeks were so bright and red, "just like
roses," and their eyes were so bright they fairly
snapped and twinkled; "but now, my dear, it's all
dough and boiled gooseberries&mdash;dough and boiled
gooseberries!" She tells us, too, of many persons,
long since gone, among whom stands, out in bold
relief and heroic proportions one 'Squire Dexter.
Then there is another person, Sally Mason, of whom
we hear repeatedly, who must have been a very deceitful
character, from what Aunty Delluvian tells
us. But why does she take such pains to tell us
so much about Sally Mason, and to convince us
that she was not pretty "one mite," only "she
had those forward, pushing ways with her, my
dear, which men find out sooner or later, my
dear, and 'Squire Dexter found her out at last, to
his sorrow." Why does she tell us this, and ask
our opinion as to whether getting into a seat in
a gig, which had been expressly reserved for another
person, was not conduct unworthy of a girl
of proper modesty and self-respect? When we
answer, as we invariably do, with feigned surprise
that such conduct "would be unpardonable,"
she straightens herself up, saying: "Well,
my dear, Sally Mason did just that thing!" Why
does Aunty Delluvian consult us on this point,
and many other trivial points concerning the pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>per
conduct of a "modest, right-minded maiden?"
It is hard to say. But, though we laugh and
quizz Aunty Delluvian about many things, we feel
that this is, somehow or another, sacred ground,
and tread gently over the graves of her dead
memories.</p>

<p>Aunty Delluvian is a great favorite in our circle.
She has many stories to tell, popular legends
in her girlhood, of General George Washington
and the Hessians and Red-Coats; and though she
does not understand the humor of the present
day, she knows some very funny verses by George
Coleman the Younger, and some riddles of the
composite order of architecture.</p>

<p>Well, Aunty Delluvian has taken quite an interest
in our theory on "Fireside Amusements."
She thinks its tendency good, for, as she justly
observes, "young people are far too stuck up nowadays;
too stuck up, my dear." So, in the goodness
of her heart, the other evening she gave a little
party, built on our principle, which we herewith
beg to report.</p>

<p>At the back of her old-fashioned country-house
spreads a green lawn, surrounded by old apple and
cherry-trees, with trunks as big round as the body
of a horse. On this lawn she gave her party.
When we arrived we found tables spread out with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a goodly array of eatables and drinkables, the aroma
of the tea mingled with the songs of the birds,
whilst the perfume of the ripe strawberries, the
grape-jelly, the steaming biscuits, and the hundred
other country delicacies, blended harmoniously with
the chirp of the crickets and the drone of the bees.
It was a pretty, a very pretty sight; the long rows
of snow-white table-cloth, the old china, the shining
silver and steel, the glittering glass, the mountains
of red strawberries surrounded by grape-leaves, and
the innumerable nosegays of bright flowers. Not
far off, in the little barn-yard, we heard the "peet-peet,"
of the young chickens, whilst the occasional
double-bass of the family cow gave delightful assurance
of the freshness of the milk and the purity
of the cream. Aunty Delluvian, clad in brown
silk with full sleeves and scanty skirt, was all bustle
and smiles. Her old handmaiden, and hired boy
from the farm-yard, and two women who were strangers
in the land of Delluvian, aided with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Between forty and fifty persons, little (some very
little) and big (some very big), sat down to tea, and
did generously by the repast. The meal concluded,
<i>dignity</i> received informal notice to quit, and all
pitched in to clear away the things. A circle of
humanity formed itself, and behold the noble sport<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of "Oats, peas, beans, and barley grows." Leading
moral philosophers, eminent divines, weather-beaten
old vikings, gallant soldiers, and care-worn editors,
sowed their seed, took their ease, stamped their feet,
clapped their hands, viewed their lands, and, after
waiting for a partner, became united in the bonds
of juvenile matrimony with little curly-headed toddlers,
and seemed to enjoy the fun just as much as
though they had never looked into a Greek lexicon,
heard the boom of cannon, or written a leader.</p>

<p>We would like to dwell long upon this merry-making
under the sky, for there occurred enough
pretty incidents and enough funny things out there
to bear telling for a week; but our mission is to instruct
our friends how to amuse others; so we
must pass from the romps in the open air to the
amusements which took place inside, after darkness
had driven the merry-makers from the lawn.</p>

<p>First in order came a great duck, chiefly made
out of a boy and a sheet. First of all we were
requested to introduce the bird, and expatiate to
the company on its qualities. For who, they said,
could speak better on the virtues of a <i>great canard</i>
than an editor? Some one, however, maliciously
mentioned that the family doctor, Mr. Pillules, was
the best person to show up a <i>quack</i>. Some one
else argued that some lady would be better qualified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to speak on Ducks; but no lady could be found
with courage enough to attempt the task, so it was
finally agreed that Dr. Pillules and ourself should
deliver a double-barrelled speech. This novel idea
was, of course, rapturously received, so the doctor
and editor were compelled, <i>nolens volens</i>, to stand
up and deliver, which we did something after the
following manner:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="558" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> "This bird which you now see before
you, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those detestable
creatures known as the <i>Canard</i>. This specimen
was recently captured down South by some of the
brave soldiers in General Grant's army on the occasion
of that gentleman's recent visit to Richmond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
This bird was formally the property of several newspaper
editors, and was used by them for the purpose
of raising fowl for the English market, where&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> "They found a ready sale, being served
up in the columns of the <i>Times</i> with peace-pudding,
and subsequently rehashed with coal lies and bully
sauce, to satisfy the cravings of the British public.
This curious bird has, however&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> "Fallen into disrepute of late, and the
people of England will have to take a big dose of
truth (a very unpleasant thing to an Englishman) to
counteract the disease which their gross indulgence
in the flesh of this foul bird has engendered; they
will likewise&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> "Be obliged to confine their diet to the
wholesome but unsavory humble pie. A kind of
pie&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> "We have often prescribed for them before.
However, the cloud-capped summits of the
mountains of Jehoshaphat&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Editor</i> (a little nonplussed). "May have <i>summit</i>
to do with the question, and then again they may
not. We are inclined to think that Jehoshaphat
was not half so fat as John Bull, and would have
scorned to eat a canard anyhow, particularly one
raised by "niggers," and hatched by steam; a bird
which Shakspeare justly remarked&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Doctor</i> (a little puzzled this time). "Didn't know
<i>beans</i>, or at all events did not care about that
wholesome and nutritious vegetable, preferring to
pick up the sentiments falling from the lips of Bull
Run Russell, or the revolting food provided for
travellers at refreshment saloons on the Camden
and Amboy Railway, which, as every one knows&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Editor.</i> "Are simply provided by that company
to kill off transient citizens of loyal States,
which they do as effectually as the greatest quack,
even were he as large as the specimen now before
us. I do not of course refer to our friend
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>How long this double-barrelled speech might
have continued, this chronicle cannot say, had not
the duck at this moment declared, in very plain
English, that "Oh thunder! he couldn't stand it
any longer, he was getting tired," which terminated
<i>that</i> part of the entertainment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 613px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="613" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="480" height="525" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The latent principle, the motive power, the core,
the occult substratum of the duck is, of course, as
in the case of the <i>vulgaris pueris</i>&mdash;a small boy.
The mode of transforming him into a duck needs
scarcely any explanation; the illustrations save all
that trouble. A board tied on the youth's back, a
sufficiency of wadding in the way of rags, and a
sheet properly arranged over all; then a ball of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>rags, with a couple of sticks for the bill, making the
head, and a newspaper cut into strips representing
the tail, and web-feet cut out of brown paper&mdash;and
there is your duck! The next thing in
order for the evening's entertainment proved to be
a little dwarf, who was exhibited on a table. He
made a speech, danced a jig, took snuff, and altogether
made himself very amusing and entertaining.
The mode of manufacturing this <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>
is, as usual, with the substratum of small boy. The
small boy paints a pair of moustaches on his upper
lip and puts a pair of boots on his hands, resting
his booted hands on a table, whilst a taller person
stands behind him and reaches his arms over the
first one's shoulders, as represented in the engrav<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>ing;
then a loose cloak or great-coat or shawl is
arranged about the dwarf so as to allow the arms of
No. 2 to project and appear as if they belonged to
No. 1. This performance should take place in a
window or doorway, where a curtain can be so
arranged as to hide the head and body of No. 2.
Then you have the dwarf all complete, as represented
in the annexed sketch. It is almost impossible
to describe this performance with precision,
as much of the arrangement must be left to the intelligence
of the exhibitor. The dwarf, however, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
may state, is very easily made when you once get
the idea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Aunty Delluvian was very much amused with
the dwarf; it reminded her of a trick that was
played on her mother's father&mdash;who was once
Governor of Massachusetts&mdash;and described by her
uncle George, who was such a droll fellow, <i>he
always had some of his puns to get off</i>. She did
not remember the story exactly, but it was
something about a dwarf being served up in a
pie at the Governor's table, in such a way that
the dwarf popped out when the Governor was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
about to carve the pie. "Oh! it was such a funny
story; if you could only have heard her uncle
George tell it," and Aunty Delluvian went into
silent convulsions of laughter at the bare memory
of the exquisite humor of uncle George's narration.
"But that was before your time, my dear; and between
you and me, the young men are very dull
nowadays, with their cigars, and their moustaches,
and their fiddle-faddle&mdash;but mum, mum, my dear,"
and Aunty Delluvian laid her fingers on her lips,
as though she had been communicating a most important
secret. As to the dwarf of this evening,
having no control over his hands, for the reason
that they belonged to the person behind him, he
was subject to the most grievous annoyance from
those members; they would persist in pulling his
own nose to a fearful extent, and performing that
manual evolution known as taking a sight in the
middle of his prettiest speech to the ladies; he,
however, enjoyed a limited revenge on one of these
occasions by catching the extended thumb between
his teeth and doing something to it, the nature of
which could only be inferred from the howl of
agony proceeding from the person immediately
behind him, and a general dislocation and disintegration
of his various members, which occurred
amidst the shouts of the spectators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>A slight pause ensuing on the completion of the
dwarf performance, afforded an opportunity to the
young man in gold spectacles to come upon the
stage. He had something very ingenious to show
us. It was a trick performed with four small seeds,
and was invented by a certain poor tutor at one of
the English universities. Although exceedingly
simple, no one had been able to discover the secret,
when finally some English nobleman, whose name
he mentioned, gave the poor tutor five hundred
pounds to reveal the mystery. Having concluded
this little introduction, the gentleman in gold spectacles
turned to Aunty Delluvian, and asked her if
she would be kind enough to let him have four
grains of rice. "Lor' bless the man! to be sure I
will, as much as ever you like!" exclaimed Aunty,
in the fulness of her generous heart, as she turned
round and called to the servant at the other end of
the room: "Here, Katy, fetch up what was left of
that cold rice-pudding we had yesterday." The
gentleman in gold spectacles hastily explained that
he did not wish the rice to be boiled, and four
grains would be ample. However, Aunty Delluvian
insisted upon all the rice in the establishment
being produced. The gentleman in gold spectacles
selected four grains, and throwing them on the
table, challenged us to arrange them in such a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ner
that <i>each grain should be precisely the same distance
from every other grain</i>, and yet the grains not
touch each other. We all took our turn till we
were tired, and then gave it up, save a couple of determined
fellows, who requested they might have till
their next meeting to find it out, which respite was
accordingly granted.</p>

<p>We were now tumultuously beset with demands
for the solution of two riddles in our last chapter.
First came the question: "Why were Moses and
the Jews the best bred people in the world?"</p>

<p>Answer. "Because they got their manna (manner)
from heaven."</p>

<p>The second was: "Why meat should always be
cooked rare?"</p>

<p>Answer. "Because what is <i>done</i> cannot be
<i>helped</i>."</p>

<p>After this came cakes and nuts and cider. Aunty
Delluvian thought nuts and cider could never come
amiss, and we agree with her when the cider is such
as she produced, clear, fruity, sparkling, which, as it
courses down your gullet, seems like health incarnate,
and as far superior to that bedevilled liquid
which city boobies call champagne, and pay three
dollars a bottle for, as faith is to smartness. So
ended our evening at Aunty Delluvian's.</p>


<hr style="width: 100%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>The Highlanders are a hardy race, inhabiting the
north of Scotland. They are brave, hospitable, and
exceedingly fond of dancing.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_108a.jpg" width="480" height="515" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_108b.jpg" width="336" height="374" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When you reflect that a very moderate nigger
<i>used</i> to fetch one thousand dollars, it will be exhilarating
to know that you can have a Highlander,
with all his natural characteristics, for nothing. Yet
such is our proposition to you on the present occasion.</p>

<p>Will you have him for nothing?</p>

<p>We assume, of course, that you have at least one
hand. A foot will not answer.</p>

<p>You have a hand?</p>

<p>Well!</p>

<p>Get an old glove and cut off the thumb and fingers
to about the extent represented in the annexed
diagram.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Place the glove on your hand, and then hold
your hand in the position represented below. You
will now have a general idea of what is to constitute
the substratum of the Highlander.</p>

<p>Now make a pair of little socks to fit your first
and second fingers. Here is a
picture of the style in which
they should be gotten up.
These socks can be made of
white linen or calico, and painted
with water-colors of the desired
pattern&mdash;the shoes black
and the socks plaid. If the colors are mixed with
very little water they will not run on the cloth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>We suggest water-colors because the plaid can be
very neatly represented by cross lines of red and
green. If, however, you have no water-colors, you
can stitch the stockings across with red and green
thread. It will be well to bear in mind that as
your second finger is longer than the first, the
stocking for the first must be stuffed out with cotton
or wool to make it equal in length to the second.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="590" height="800" alt="THE HIGHLANDER TRICK." title="" />

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now make a careful copy of our full-page picture
opposite; stitch it on to the back of the glove;
put the socks on your fingers, and your Highlander
is ready to dance, as represented in the above cut.</p>

<p>You move about the fingers, simulating a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
dancing the Highland-fling or double-shuffle, and
the result will be very curious and eminently satisfactory.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Another variation of the same performance can
be made, which will save the trouble of drawing a
Highlander. It is done thus: You procure a kid
glove, and cut it down as before. You will see by
the subjoined cut how the hand looks with the glove
on before it has been fixed up. A white kid glove
is best, because on the white kid you can paint
almost the entire dress with water-colors&mdash;blue
vest, red sash, and black pantaloons. A little piece
of some gay rag must, however, be stitched on each
side to represent the jacket; the chief object of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the jacket being to hide the knuckles of the third
and fourth fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="480" height="526" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, having fixed your glove and put it on,
paint on your hand a face in the style of the following
sketch, and your dancing Spaniard, or Terpsichorean
Matadore, is ready for action. The glove
forms a complete suit (barring the boots), which
you can slip off and on with the greatest ease at
pleasure.</p>

<p>If you have not a white kid glove wherewith to
make the dress of the above-mentioned gentleman,
you will have to sew a small piece of calico or
paper in the proper place, for the shirt. You will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
also be obliged to make him a vest out of some
little scrap of red or blue silk; in short, you must
use your needle instead of your paint-brush. But
this is plain enough and needs no further explanation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="640" height="325" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There is one more item, however, which we must
mention. It will be found rather difficult to paint
moustaches on the hand so as to give them the
right merry expression. The teeth, which lend so
much life to the face, are troublesomely small to
represent. We therefore think it best to draw a
pair of moustaches exactly similar to the ones we
subjoin, which can be made to stick in their place
by the aid of a little diaclon or shoemaker's wax.</p>

<p>The scientific gentleman at our last meeting
bewildered us all with four grains of rice. It will
be remembered that he challenged us to arrange
those four seeds in such a manner that each should
be an equal distance from each, and yet not touch
each other. Did we belong to the betting class, we
would be willing to wager a moderately-sized cobble-stone
that not one of our readers has yet solved
the problem. It is explained thus: You lay three
of the seeds on the table in the form of an equilateral
triangle; then taking the fourth seed between
the finger and thumb, you hold it above the
other three, in the position represented in diagram
on page 106. In this way, and this alone, can
the objects be so arranged as to be each equidistant
from each. It is a very simple matter when
once explained, but we never yet knew any one to
find it out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/i_116a.jpg" width="640" height="460" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Our friend Nix is in very fervid condition concerning
a new picturesque trick he has learned. It
is an old affair, but very funny, and consists in
making an old woman's face with your fist, and is
done as follows: You double your fist, as represented
in the above diagram, and draw on it a
face as also represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/i_116b.jpg" width="636" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Then you make a species of hood something like
a mitten, with a hole in the side, around which hole
you sew a frill, to make it look like a cap, which we
also illustrate with a diagram. The mitten is
placed on the hand, and a shawl pinned carefully
round it, as shown in our diagram on page 108, and
you have the old woman complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="550" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, in order to make the old woman appear to
speak, you must move the knuckle of the thumb up
and down, at the same time simulate a cracked,
squeaky old voice. By moving your thumb in
time to your voice, the illusion becomes perfect.
You can, of course, make the old woman say whatever
you please; but the more emphatic the style<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of her conversation the better, as you can make the
jaw more energetic, and the pauses more marked.
The conversation might commence something in
this style (you in your natural tone of voice):
"Well, aunty, how are <i>you</i> to-day?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Aunty Grummidge: "How am I? Ah! Hum!
I'm well enough if it warn't for them plaguey boys!
Drat the boys! Heavin' stones at my geese! I'll
geese them, if I ketch 'em! Drat 'em! and tramplin'
all over my string-beans! Drat 'em! I'll
string-bean 'em, if I ketch hold of 'em! And then
the pesky young warmints callin' me old Dot-and-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>go-one!
I'll old Dot-and-go-one them, if I ketch
hold of 'em."</p>

<p>It will require a little practice to keep time between
the thumb and the voice; but by making
the phrases short and emphatic, it will be soon
learned. When the old woman has done talking,
you can stick a pipe in her mouth, and make her
look quite comfortable.</p>

<p>"<i>In those days there were giants.</i>" Those days
were the days when our mother was a young lady,
and, as we devoutly believe, the most beautiful
woman of her period; when our father's side-whiskers
were glossy black; when he wore his hat just
a <i>leetle</i> bit on one side, and when they twain used
now and then to go forth magnificently arrayed
after the lamps were lit, to balls and parties, whilst
we little ones sat up in our white beds to receive
the parting kiss and injunction flavored with blessings
and <i>eau de cologne</i>. In those days, we repeat,
there were giants. Giants in our story-books,
giants in our young imaginations, mere suckers
from the parent stem of the story-books, but terrible
in their proportions. There were giants, too,
in our narrow path, springing out of our waywardness
and evil passions, and the evil passions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
others; there were giants, too, on the road to
knowledge; oh, such monstrous giants all of them,
far bigger and fiercer than any we ever met in after
life. But there was another giant of a far different
sort, who used to make his appearance at our little
parties about Christmas-time, and in sustaining
whose character we have over and over again sweltered
and staggered and suffered martyrdom the
most terrible. Still he was a pleasant giant (particularly
to the upper-story boy), and welcome to
the whole company. He had a very youthful look,
in spite of his ferocious moustache; his hat had a
tendency to drop over his eyes and his gait was erratic;
though his proportions inspired awe in the hearts
of the tiny portion of the audience. We have but
rarely met this gentleman in later days, partially,
we fancy, from a difficulty in procuring legs; we
have observed a growing disinclination in persons
to perform these members; indeed, we have ourself
shrunk several times from the task. It is, indeed,
an ordeal rather severe, after partaking heartily of
Christmas dinner, and, perhaps, generously of wine,
to walk about a hot room with a warm boy on your
shoulders, and your entire person&mdash;head, face, and all&mdash;enveloped
in a heavy cloak or overcoat, and not a
breath of fresh air to be taken under penalty of
<i>spoiling the giant</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>A small and cool boy is placed on the shoulders
of a man or boy who is stout in the legs; a long
military cloak or overcoat is thrown over the two,
and the monster is made. You can embelish him
with moustaches, a hat, and a long walking-cane,
and then you will have the creature complete, as
represented in the picture opposite.</p>

<p>Folly is better than physic. If no one ever
made this aphorism before, we at once lay claim to
and include it in our copyright; entered according
to act of Congress in the clerk's office, and all the
rest of it. A good old-fashioned time we had
of it last Christmas evening at the house of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
friend Nix. What a happy, merry, jolly crowd of
noodles, ninnies, judies, tomfools, and undignified
people we were to be sure! Nix gave himself unheard-of
moustaches and eyebrows with India-ink,
and then washed himself into the likeness of a boss
chimney-sweep, in which condition he remained
the whole evening, and came to business the next
day with a faint tinge of the dusty pigment under
his left ear, although he averred that he had parboiled
himself over night with scalding soap and
water in honest efforts to remove the oriental
stain.</p>

<p>At this distance of time it would be hard to recall
who were the guests at this tomfool's festival,
even had we ever known them all; but a fluttering
of little faces and pink sashes, and very bunchy
frocks suggestive of new crinoline&mdash;indeed, now we
think of it, one <i>wee</i> thing told us emphatically she
had on a "noo hoop-stirt," and raised her short red
frock to show us the inestimable treasure; and
that again reminds us of  another toddler, of the
masculine persuasion, who thrice called our attention
to his new boots, and once requested us to
feel the soles where his mother had scratched them
with her scissors to prevent his slipping on the
carpets. But, as we were saying, a certain confused
picture of fluttering pink sashes, bunchy crinoline,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
blue eyes, and flushed cheeks, is one of the <i>chefs-d'&#339;uvre</i>
in the private gallery of our memory, and
was nearly all we carried away from that foolish
Christmas carnival. We remember, though, Aunty
Delluvian, in all the pomp, pride, and circumstance
of a dress which might have been described by
some fashionable <i>modiste</i> of fifty years ago, but
before which the steel nibs of a modern pen grow
parched and gape inkless in their course over the
<i>cream laid</i>. We can state that it was of silk, and very
thick, and rustled, and had an odor, not of myrrh&mdash;for
that we have purchased at the drug stores as being
good for the gums&mdash;though perhaps of frankincense,
but certainly of some Eastern perfume; and there
our descriptive capacity ends. Concerning certain
gems and trinkets, also worn by that worthy lady,
we are equally humble and bewildered; but if our
memory serves us rightly, they were chiefly of pale
and yellow stones surrounded by pearls, and of oval
and slender forms, save one sombre brooch (she
wore in the neck of her dress under a bow of ribbon),
which has hair in it, and was shown us as a rare
piece of workmanship and a great relic; indeed,
Aunty Delluvian informed us, very confidentially,
that a person by the name of Sally Mason would
have given her ears to possess it once&mdash;from which
we judged it to be of great value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The scientific gentleman was there; and others
"too numerous to mention," as the advertisements
say. One of the company, whom we had never met
before, left a particular impression on our mind, partly
because he came from a far-off land, with a large
budget of strange knowledge and exotic ideas, and
partly because he showed us a quite curious and
simple little toy. Among other things he expatiated
on the dexterity of the Australasian savages
in the use of the boomerang, which they would
throw in such a way as to make it skim entirely
around a house and return to their feet. He told
us that one of these savages would seize his boomerang
and send it whirling into a flock of parrots,
bringing down half a dozen of the birds, and then
return to his feet. He added that parrot-pie
was excellent eating; a statement which sent a
thrill of indignation through the juvenile portion of
the company. The idea of cooking birds that say
"Pretty Poll!" While the young were indignant,
many of the elders felt incredulous, touching the
boomerang; one person, indeed, delicately hinting
that "throwing the boomerang" must be the Australasian
equivalent of our expression "pulling
the long bow;" but Aunty Delluvian, who had just
heard the latter part of the discourse, came gallantly
to the rescue (she had taken rather a <i>notion</i> to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
young Australian). She assured the company that
there could be no doubt of the existence of the boomerang,
for an uncle of hers had on a certain occasion
brought one from China, and that it grew so tame
that it would come and feed out of your hand. This
statement, as may be supposed, produced a profound
sensation, which good breeding alone prevented
from being an explosion. Several persons present
tried to hush the matter up by suggesting that the
good lady probably confounded the instrument in
question with a baboon or orang-outang. But
Aunty Delluvian would listen to nothing of the
kind; <i>no compromises for her</i>. "Bless the child,
she had seen it with her own eyes, and it went all
round the house and came back to her feet, and
caught the pigeon, and killed the parrot, just as the
gentleman described." However, the young antipodean
asserted his own veracity very effectively by
offering to manufacture a model of the weapon then
and there.</p>

<p>"If you will only provide me," he said, "with a
good stiff card&mdash;an old playing-card will do as well
as anything&mdash;I will soon satisfy you that what I
described <i>can</i> be done."</p>

<p>The card was produced, and in a couple of minutes
he had with a pair of scissors clipped out a
piece of the size and shape of the subjoined dia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>gram.
He then borrowed a book and a lead pencil,
and placed the miniature boomerang on the former,
with one end projecting over the edge of the book
about an inch. He then took the book in his left
hand, and holding it at a slight angle as represented
in the diagram, page 119, struck the projecting end
a smart blow with the pencil. This sent it whirling
through the air towards the opposite corner of
the ceiling, which it nearly though not quite
reached&mdash;then it came fluttering back to the very
feet of the performer. This operation was repeated
several times with almost universal applause, the
only dissentient voice being that of a little shaver
of five, who wanted to see the parrots come down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 514px;">
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" width="514" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>About this time it became evident that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
mysterious preparations were being made outside.
A good deal of whispering occurred, and Nix, with
one or two others, disappeared from the apartment.
We, in the meantime, amused ourselves with sundry
time-honored experiments. First came an optical
illusion-trick, the fun of which consisted in the
futile efforts of several persons to knock a cork off
a fork with the fore-finger; and is performed thus:
A steel fork, or some other sharp instrument, is stuck
in the door, and a cork placed on the end of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="520" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 555px;">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="555" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The person wishing to test his skill places himself
in front of it; fixing his eyes on the cork, he
then walks slowly backwards ten or twelve feet, his
eyes still fixed on the cork; having done which, he
extends his right hand, closes an eye, and advances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>towards the cork, till he thinks he has reached
near enough to knock the cork from its position
with one blow of the finger. Nine times out of ten
the performers fail, as they did on the occasion in
question. This experiment seemed to afford a
good excuse to a certain little witch, with black eyes,
to propose the performance of pinning a thimbleful
of water to the wall. The thimble was filled with
water, a pin borrowed, and mademoiselle, escorted
by her cavalier&mdash;a young gentleman in patent-leather
boots, and breathing incense from every
curl of his hair, and from every part of his dress, to
a degree calculated to drive Phalon mad and ruin
the reputation of Arabia. Escorted by this exqui<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>site
being, the young lady repaired to the spot
selected for the experiment; but, alas! just as she
was about to fix the thimble to the wall the pin
dropped to the floor. In an instant the perfumed
gallant was on his knees searching for the lost article,
and with equal promptitude the treacherous
belle had emptied the water on his fragrant pate,
amid the roars of laughter of those around&mdash;for in
this consisted the trick.</p>

<p>While we were still laughing the door opened,
and Nix entered, somewhat flushed, and with a
comical frown on his brow.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he began, "I have a
serious complaint to make&mdash;really it is too bad.
Upon my life it is. I think Miss Mary Fenn and
Miss Julia Farley, and several of the other young
ladies, ought to be spoken to" (the ladies mentioned
and several others here colored up and looked rather
scared). "I think they ought to be very seriously
spoken to, going round in this reckless way. Why,
upon my life, there's no knowing what may happen&mdash;and
they don't care one bit. They care no more
for a fellow-creature than I do for a fly. Ah! (with
a sigh) there is one feller-creature which I wish
they would think a little more of. In common
honesty they ought to do something to their eyes&mdash;wear
spectacles, or something of that sort; and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
their lips, since nature has seen fit not to provide
them with moustaches, they might use respirators
or&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;well, something has to be done, or
there won't be a sane man in the neighborhood. I
myself have a severe pain in my left side; and here,
when I go outside&mdash;I don't mean the left side, but
outside the room&mdash;for a little temporary relief, I
find a poor fellow maimed, probably for life&mdash;his
head completely turned."</p>

<p>At this point a figure resembling the opposite
sketch walks in, and declares that he would not
have his head turned back for the world; on the
contrary, he finds his present position far more
comfortable than any other, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="461" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The construction of this figure is so simple that
it seems almost superfluous to explain it. The
person performing it puts on a loose coat and vest,
wrong side foremost, fastens a false face to the back
of his head, and a wig over his face, and the whole
is complete. The wig may be made of curled hair
from an old mattress, sewed on to a black silk cap.
By the way, while we are on the subject, we may as
well say a word or two more concerning this curled
hair, which will be found very useful for amateur
theatricals. With a handful of this cheap material
(the imitation or grass substitute will answer just
as well), you can make beards, whiskers, and mous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>taches
of any desired shape. All that is required
is to twist, stretch, or mould the tangled mass into
the desired shape, and then, in the proper place,
stick on a small piece of diachylon, and the appendage
is ready for use. The diachylon can be purchased
in lump form of any druggist. In order to
adhere it to the face, it should be slightly warmed
before the fire.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, bless my soul alive, if the poor fellow's
head isn't turned!" exclaimed Aunty Delluvian,
in unfeigned surprise. "Well, some foolish fellows
do get their heads turned by the girls,"
and the good old lady laughed heartily, honestly
believing she had made a joke. Indeed, she patted
us on the knee to draw our attention, as she
added, in an explanatory way:</p>

<p>"You know, when I was a girl, and any young
fellow fell in love with one of the girls, we used
to say his head was turned; so I say that young
man's head is turned&mdash;don't you see!" and again
the old lady went off in a transport of merriment
at her own wit. But in a moment it was over,
and when we turned there was something glistening
in her eye, as she looked dreamily before
her out of that Christmas-day away off, doubtless,
to some other Christmas-day when young men had
their heads turned by designing young women.
But there was no time for reverie; for Nix, who
had assumed the position of showman, now made
himself heard, bellowing through his nose:</p>

<p>"Now, ladies and gentleman, I will proceed to
show you a highly moral exhibition, some of the
four-footed works of nature, or, as they are commonly
called, quadrupedals. This exhibition, by
calling the mind to contemplate the works of na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ture,
elevates the soul to things above, and makes
us all better fathers, husbands, wives, sweethearts,
sons, and girls to do general housework. Now,
ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you who, after
contemplating the rhinoceros, would fail to return
home a more dutiful parent or respectful sweetheart?
But, to step from the realms of fancy to
the practical regions of fact, I will proceed to interdooce
to you that splendid anumile Saladin, the
royal Bengal tiger, from Botteny Bay, in the West
Injees. This wonderful creature measures sixteen
feet from the tip of the tail to the tip of the snout,
and sixteen feet from the tip of the snout to the tip
of the tail, making in all thirty-two feet."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="636" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>At this point of his oration the showman paused,
opened the door, and gave a loud whistle, when in
scampered a creature more easily sketched than de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>scribed.
At first we did not recognise the stub-tailed
bull-terrier Snap, so completely was he disguised
and bestriped with black paint, more to
resemble a zebra, however, than a tiger. Snap, all
unconscious of his new character, began frisking and
capering round, wagging his tail <i>vociferously</i>, as
Nix expressed it.</p>

<p>"This beautiful but terrible creature," continued
Nix, "is exquisitely marked by nature. His, however,
are not good-conduct marks, for, in his native
wilds, his behavior is anything but proper. He
will devour anything that comes in his way, having
been known, when pressed by hunger, to eat even
an alderman. Such being the nature of the beast,
I will now proceed to show you a more amiable
specimen of this moral exhibition. This, ladies and
gentlemen, is the largest of all animals. It belongs
to Asia and Africa. We have no elephants, naturally,
in America, any more than we have Irishmen.
They are all imported at great expense, two ships
being required to bring over each creature, one for
himself, and one for his trunk, I believe."</p>

<p>Enter elephant (adjoining page).</p>

<p>"The elephant lives chiefly on ginger-snaps, sugar,
rice, and cayenne pepper, which, at the present
price of groceries, makes his board come rather
heavy. You have all heard of the sagacity of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>elephant&mdash;how he squirted the dirty water over
that injudicious tailor who ran his needle into the
elephant's trunk. But, ladies and gentlemen, I was
witness to a more singular instance of intelligence
on the part of this elephant here, which is, perhaps,
the largest of its kind ever imported to this
country. While passing through the streets of one
of our inland towns during the late election,
this very anumile seized a slip of paper from one of
the crowd, rushed up to the polls, and actually
voted the Union ticket before we knew what he
was about."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">
<img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="469" height="800" alt="HOW TO MAKE AN ELEPHANT." title="" />
<span class="caption">HOW TO MAKE AN ELEPHANT. <i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_126">126</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>In this strain Nix continued for some time, while
the elephant walked round the room. Little boys
were mounted on his back for a ride, and enjoyed
the fun hugely.</p>

<p>The scientific gentleman with gold spectacles
threw a temporary damper on the merriment by
asking, in a sombre voice, whether we knew how
many times round the elephant's foot was equal to
his height, and then equally solemnly informing us
that it was "Twice." Having said "twice!" very
emphatically, he became silent, and the fun went
on.</p>

<p>Now comes the question&mdash;How was the elephant
made? A glance at the annexed picture will throw
considerable light on the subject at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we have the usual human substratum. Two
gentlemen, wearing rubbers, place themselves in
the position represented, while the foremost one
holds something in his hands. This is a grey
shawl or table-cover, rolled up to represent the
elephant's trunk, which the performer swings about
to produce a life-like effect. All that now remains
to be done is to procure another grey shawl and
spread it over the united operators, fastening two
pieces of round paper, with black dots on them, in
the proper places, for eyes, and a couple of rags or
old gloves for ears. The elephant is now complete,
save the tusks. These can be made out of long
pieces of twisted white paper, pinned to the inside of
the shawl, and there you have a first-rate elephant
for a small tea-party. Dish, and serve up with
lots of <i>sass</i>, as the cookery books say. But let us
listen to Nix; he is spouting some more nonsense:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen: This elephant was captured
and imported into this country by a Bengal
officer, Colonel Gurramuchy, whom I shall have
much pleasure in introducing to you. You have all
heard of Cumming&mdash;well, he is coming."</p>

<p>Here entered the most extraordinary being we
had ever beheld; a very military-looking person,
with a very small head and an exceedingly long
neck. However, refer to the illustration, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>you see him faithfully portrayed. Following him
was an equally singular person, who was presented
to us as Captain Dawk, a particular friend of the
Colonel's, whose portrait we likewise subjoin.
These gentlemen chatted with Nix, and told us one
or two of their hunting adventures&mdash;the most extravagant
yarns. We have only space for one,
which we shall condense as much as possible.
Captain Dawk once, while hunting the wild boar
in India, had the misfortune to have his horse
ripped open by the tusks of the infuriated beast.
His horse of course fell heavily, and died almost
immediately. While he was standing at the side of
the poor creature, deploring his loss, and wondering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>how he should ever reach home, he beheld at some
distance from him, on the open plain, a huge tiger
approaching. There was no tree within miles; to
run away would have been useless; he at once bethought
himself of an idea. Seizing his hunting-knife,
he rapidly removed the internals of the horse,
and crept into the cavity himself. The tiger, on
coming up, seized the horse by the neck, and
dragged it several miles to its den in the jungle,
where it commenced at once to feast upon the carcass.
Watching a favorable opportunity, when the
tiger had eaten a hole in the horse's side, Captain
Dawk drew a small revolver from his pocket, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
shot the animal dead. He was just in the act of
crawling from his place of concealment when he
beheld five more tigers approaching. Four of these
he shot one after the other from inside the horse,
and then all his ammunition was exhausted, and one
tiger was left alive; but, drawing his knife, he resolved
to sell his life dearly. Here the Captain gave
us a most harrowing account of his encounter with
the last tiger, which was larger than any of the
others. First it broke both his legs, then his arms,
then his back, and finally the ferocious beast got
the officer's head into its mouth&mdash;but to conclude
in his own words: "I felt the hot breath in my
face, the sharp teeth pressing both sides of my
skull. In another instant I felt all would be over,
and my worst fears were realized. With one gripe
the wretched brute bit off my head, and then tearing
me limb from limb, devoured me on the spot."
This story was pronounced a stunner.</p>

<p>But how were these extraordinary faces produced?
First, we will refer our readers to the
diagram, which will explain a good deal, and then
throw what light we can on the subject with words.</p>

<p>The face of the Colonel was made by painting an
entire set of features on the forehead with India-ink.
The white of the eyes in both cases was
effected by wetting the finger and rubbing it on an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
enamelled visiting-card; by this means you take a
good deal of the white from the card which can be
transferred to the proper place on the forehead.
In the case of the Colonel, if the performer moves
his eyebrows up and down as he is speaking, it will
communicate a motion to the pointed moustaches,
and a most comical expression to the entire face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="480" height="542" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>To make the second face, you must, if possible,
get some one with very light eyebrows and no
moustaches; then paint eyes and eyebrows on the
forehead, which must be done artistically, shadows
and all, and connect them, as represented, with the
bridge of the nose, paint heavy black moustaches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and your performer will have the appearance of possessing
an immensely long face; he must, however,
keep his eyes shut, or the illusion will be dispelled.</p>

<p>After this performance, the scene, as painted on
our memory, resolves itself into blue eyes, pink
ribbons, bunchy skirts, oranges, candies, lemonades,
wax-lights, Christmas-trees, Aunty Delluvian, and
endless smiling faces.</p>

<p>May all good people have as foolish, merry a
Christmas as we had at Aunty Delluvian's!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>Hanky-panky is the name of a certain art practised
by pantomimists of the clown and harlequin
school, and is the subject of no little study and
practice. We do not think it within our power to
define hanky-panky, composed as it is of fictitious
whackings and kickings and smackings, unless, indeed,
that be a definition. We can, however, give
a couple of illustrations of the art as it may be
practised in the family circle. We may look further
into the matter at some future day, and possibly
issue a volume of Parlor hanky-panky, beautifully
illustrated by the author.</p>

<p>The first example we shall now give is how to
knock your knuckles on the edge of a marble mantel-piece
or other hard substance without hurting
them. It is done thus: You raise your clenched
fist high in the air, hold it poised there some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
seconds for all the audience to see, and then bring
it swiftly down; but just before your hand reaches
the object, open your fingers quickly, so they will
strike the object with a sharp slap, then close them
quickly; if this is neatly done, it will appear as if
you had struck your knuckles a violent blow. This
will make the ladies scream, and every one else
thrill of horror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="520" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The second feat of hanky-panky consists in
knocking your head against the edge of a door with
such apparent force as to break your skull, provided
it be anything under an inch thick.</p>

<p>This you do by holding your hand which is farthest
from the audience on a level with your face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
as represented in the annexed picture. At the
moment your forehead touches the edge you must
give the side of the door a good smart bang with
the palm of your hand. To the audience on the
other side of the door, who do not see this motion
of the hand, you appear to have given your poor
head a terrific blow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="480" height="626" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Another piece of hanky-panky frequently prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>tised
on the stage requires two performers. No. 1
aims a blow at the head of No. 2; No. 2, just as
the blow reaches him, raises both hands as though
to guard the blow, managing, however, as he does
so to slap them smartly together so as to produce a
loud report. If the blow and the report occur
simultaneously, No. 1 will appear to have given
No. 2 a most vicious box on the ear.</p>

<p>This is all we have to say about hanky-panky.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>Being in a tranquil mood the other evening, and
indisposed for the rollicking fun and tomfoolery in
which, we are glad to say, we have so often indulged,
we called upon our friend Nix to pass a
quiet hour or two. When we had explained the
object of our visit, Nix replied that it was well, for
although he could not entertain us himself in the
character of host, he could introduce us to a family
to whom he happened to be engaged himself that
evening.</p>

<p>"They are," said he, "the most charming people
in the world&mdash;all ladies, excepting a little pickle
of a boy, a child after your own heart, by the way;
not one of your impulsive, high-spirited humbugs,
who does all sorts of vicious things for twelve hours,
and is sorry for them for five minutes; not one
of your easy penitents, who is never ashamed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
owning himself in the wrong, and at the same time
never too proud to do wrong; but a stubborn, sensitive,
ingenuous, affectionate, fun-loving little fellow.
Do you know I like people who, when they are
mad, get sulky? I have found they make the best
of friends, the best servants, and the best members
of society generally. I wonder who started the
admiration of <i>impulsive</i> people? 'Oh!' you hear
a young lady say, who never really gave the subject
five minutes' thought in her life, and is quite
unconscious that she is repeating a hackneyed sentiment
which has been knocking about the world
for the last fifty years; 'oh!' you hear her say,
'I like quick-tempered people, who get into a passion
and are over it in a minute.' Then you hear
some one else: 'Oh, yes, he does wrong, but he is
full of fine impulses!' For my part, I think these
impulsive folks are the greatest humbugs in the
world. In the first place, there is scarcely any
villany which cannot be perpetrated in a moment,
if you have only the necessary impulse; but then,
to look into the origin of this impulsiveness, it
arises altogether from a lack of self-control, a violent,
self-indulgent spirit. Then, as to ready repentance
and confession, that, to my mind, is the
worst sign man, woman, or child can show; it simply
shows they do not fully appreciate the serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>ness
of their offence, or are so devoid of pride that
they do not care in what estimation they are held
by others; or, as is often the case, it is a cheap
way of squaring accounts and starting afresh, perhaps
on better terms than before, with people who
like <i>impulsive</i> characters. Bah! Confession and
repentance ought to come out of a man with tears
of blood, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But about the ladies?" we broke in. "Your
dissertation on character is very good, but I think
you made use of the adjective charming in connection
with the noun ladies."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Nix, suddenly changing his
manner, for he had grown quite fierce and enthusiastic
in his tirade against impulsive persons. "The
ladies&mdash;'that man who would lay his hand on a lady
in aught save kindness, is unworthy the name of a
British officer and a gentleman.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A wife, a dog, and a walnut-tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more you lick 'em, the better they be.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>. But you said something
about the ladies. Well, this family comprises a
widow, three daughters, and little pickle aforementioned.
These ladies, I may tell you, are not only
ladies, but gentlewomen&mdash;a very, very rare article,
I can assure you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"True," we responded; "painfully true."</p>

<p>"These ladies have found out&mdash;no, there I am
wrong; they never gave the subject a thought.
But they are illustrations of the fact, though they
are ignorant of it, for their good-breeding came to
them partly by nature and partly by careful, motherly,
Christian training. They are illustrations of
the fact, that to be gentlewomen it is necessary to
be gentle women."</p>

<p>"Women do not appear to be generally aware of
that fact," we chimed in.</p>

<p>"These ladies, although full of intelligence and
<i>esprit</i>, besides being highly educated and accomplished,
could not, I believe, give a smart retort to&mdash;to&mdash;to
save their eyes; and when you see their
eyes you will be able to judge of the value of the
stake. If any one were to make a rude or impertinent
speech to them they would not understand
him. As they never wound the feelings of others,
they cannot imagine any one else doing so."</p>

<p>"But," said we, "there are certain forms of words
which no one could possibly mistake&mdash;not even the
simplest of human beings."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I don't refer to such cases as
those! Under such circumstances, my friends
would feel deeply grieved, and even rebuke the
offender. But as to making one of those sharp re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>torts
in which underbred young women so greatly
delight, why, they could no more do it than fly!"</p>

<p>Fortunately, at this point in Nix's harangue, we
reached the door of the ladies under discussion; for
be it understood that most of our conversation had
occurred on our way thither.</p>

<p>We doubt whether it is a good plan to praise one's
friends too highly before an introduction; it is calculated
to produce a reaction. At least, we felt
just the least shade of disappointment on being
ushered into the presence of the subject of our
companion's eulogy. Four plainly-dressed, oval-faced,
soft-eyed ladies, seated round a large centre-table,
on which were strewn water-colors, albums,
scissors, and scraps of paper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nix has told us all so much about you,"
said the eldest, "that I feel as though we were
old friends. My daughters are now enthusiastic on
the subject of transparencies, and I've no doubt
your ingenuity will enable them to solve many
knotty points beyond their amateur capacity."</p>

<p>We soon found, however, that we were the one
to learn, for the work on which the white fingers
were engaged was something entirely new to us.
There were beautiful transparencies, mostly representing
landscapes, and cut out of writing-paper.
We immediately became a devoted student of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>art of transparent picture-making, with a single
eye, of course, to the amusement of our readers.
The soft, brown eyes, the taper fingers, and the
gentle manners, had nothings to do with our assiduity,
upon which we pledge our sacred honor, as
a Calmuc Tartar.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 727px;">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="727" height="580" alt="PAPER TRANSPARENCIES." title="" />
<span class="caption">PAPER TRANSPARENCIES.&mdash;<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_143">143</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>We will now proceed to explain, if those white
fingers do not get in the way, how these pictures
are produced; and first, according to our custom,
we refer the reader to the annexed diagram (No. 1)&mdash;a
diagram is a good basis to start upon. Before
you look at the diagram, it would be well to
collect the necessary materials, which are as follows:</p>

<p>Several sheets of writing-paper.</p>

<p>One piece, say four inches square, of thick paper
or card.</p>

<p>A pair of small fine-pointed scissors.</p>

<p>A sharp-pointed penknife.</p>

<p>A small piece of charcoal. Burnt grape-vine or
cedar makes the best.</p>

<p>A piece of transparent tracing-paper.
A black lead-pencil.</p>

<p>Pen and ink.</p>

<p>A thick pasteboard, or thin pine board, about
the thickness of an ordinary book-cover, and at
least two inches longer and wider than the picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
you are about to make. A sheet of glass will answer
as well, perhaps better.</p>

<p>A small quantity of thin, fine paste, free from
lumps, made of flour and water boiled. Mind that
it is boiled and free from lumps.</p>

<p>Now see the diagram No. 1. This is the
picture you wish to produce in the transparency.
Take your tracing-paper, and with a pen
and ink make an outline of this picture, having
done which, rub the charcoal over the back of the
tracing, then lay the tracing-paper on a sheet of letter-paper,
take your lead-pencil in your hand; now,
every mark you make on the tracing-paper with the
pencil will leave a corresponding charcoal mark on
the paper beneath it. Bearing this in mind, you
will draw your pencil carefully round the outline of
the moon, the window of the old castle, and the
bright light in the water. Now carefully remove
the tracing-paper, and you will find the forms of
these objects faintly marked in charcoal lines on
the writing-paper. Now, with the fine point (it
must have a fine point) of your lead-pencil, travel
over the charcoal lines, so as to make them distinct
and permanent. You do so because the charcoal
easily brushes off. You will then proceed to brush
off the charcoal with a soft rag as soon as you have
made your pencil outline. You will now, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
scissors or penknife, whichever is most convenient
for the purpose, cut out the parts you have traced&mdash;that
is to say, a round hole for the moon, a small
square patch for the castle window, and a few
irregular slits for the water. Then you will have a
piece of paper like diagram No. 2 (page 152).</p>

<p>There now, we think we managed to keep the
white fingers out of that pretty well, though it was
pretty hard work, rest assured. So far so good.
Now you want to cut a piece of paper, which shall
be your second tint, to represent the clouds and
water. To this end you again lay your outline
tracing on the white paper, and trace the shape of
the clouds, the castle window, and the lights on the
water, which will give you a form similar to that
represented in diagram No. 3 (page 153). This
you will cut out as before.</p>

<p>Now you wish for a tint to represent the distant
mountains and the reflection of the old castle;
therefore, trace and cut out as before directed a
piece of paper corresponding with the outlines of
these forms, which piece will correspond exactly
with diagram No. 4 (page 154). Now you will cut
out a piece of paper to represent the nearer mountains
and the castle, which will correspond with
diagram No. 5 (page 155). After which you will
cut a piece to represent the castle alone; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
lastly, you cut out of your card the form of the fir-tree
and old railing in the foreground, and the
chief part of your labor is done.</p>

<p>Again we must congratulate ourself on keeping
those little fingers out of our description, though
they have been playing about like white mice
among our ideas all the time. We only trust we
have made the process clear to our readers.</p>

<p>We will now presume you wish to mount your
transparency on a sheet of glass. First take the
piece of white paper corresponding with diagram No.
2, and cover it with a thin coat of paste, being careful
that it is free from lumps, and lay it on the glass,
pressing it evenly all over with a soft handkerchief.
Over this, in its proper place, paste No. 3, over that
No. 4, and so on, one over the other, till they are
all on. You can now hold it up to the light to see
if the reflected lights in the water are correct; if
not, wait till the transparency is dry, and brighten
them up by cutting the necessary pieces out with
the sharp point of a penknife. All that needs
doing now is to paste over all a thin sheet of white
paper. This need only be pasted round the edges
just enough to make it keep its place. To give
the picture a finish, it should either be put in a frame
or have a border of gilt paper or other untranslucent
material pasted round it to conceal the ragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
edges of the picture. Now your picture is complete.
Hold it once more up to the light, and you
will be surprised what a beautiful effect is produced.</p>

<p>If the transparency be not to be mounted in glass,
the process is as follows: Cut a square hole, a trifle
smaller than the picture, in the board you have
provided; cut a piece of white paper of the same
shape as the hole, only about one inch larger each
way; moisten it slightly with a wet rag, then put
some paste all round the edges of the paper, and
paste it over the square hole in the board; keep
the paper slightly moistened till the paste has
thoroughly dried; then you can allow the paper to
dry, when it will become smooth and tight like the
head of a drum. On this you can paste the transparency
in the same way you did on the glass.</p>

<p>Our young lady friends had a number of wonderful
things produced in this way, into some of which
they had introduced color with remarkable effect.
In the design we have given as an example, being
one of the simplest in their collection, the light in
the castle window was red, and threw long rays of
red light across the rocks, with a red reflection in
the water. This was easily done with a little water-color
(crimson lake); but we refrained from introducing
it into our description, for fear of compli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>cating
the matter and puzzling the reader. However,
when you have made the one we have
described, you will soon see a number of other
effects which can be produced&mdash;sunsets with a
moving sun, rain-storms, floating clouds; skies
and water painted blue, and trees green, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Little Pickle did not take any active part in the
transparency business, though he looked on admiringly,
occasionally throwing in a few words of
applause or advice, something in this style:</p>

<p>"Oh! I say, Lucy, couldn't you put a cow in
there; it would look fust-rate. I can draw a cow,
all but the feet, and you can hide them behind the
rocks, you know."</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ah&mdash;yes&mdash;that snow is pretty good, only
that feller has only got one runner to his sled!"</p>

<p>It is strange that boys will always say <i>feller</i> and
<i>fust-rate</i>.</p>

<p>Little Pickle was not, however, idle in his way.
While we were studying white fingers, brown eyes,
and transparencies, he had cut out a sled, a wheel-barrow,
and manufactured a dancing-pea. The
latter he made by running a pin half way through a
pea, one end of which he stuck into a broken piece
of tobacco-pipe. He then threw his head back till
the tobacco-pipe attained a perpendicular position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
when he commenced blowing, which made the pea
dance in the air in the most amusing manner for
nearly a minute. The mode of arranging the pea,
as well as of using it, is illustrated in the accompanying
sketch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="480" height="482" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He likewise horrified us all by suddenly appearing
with a hideous double row of protruding yellow
teeth, which he coolly dropped into the palm of his
hand, when he thought our feelings had been sufficiently
outraged.</p>

<p>"They are only made of orange-peel," he explained.
"You just cut a slit there, and notch
them along like that, and then put them into your
mouth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 508px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="508" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, in order to convey to your mind, dear
reader, the method of constructing this ornament,
shall we tell you to cut an elliptical piece of orange,
and then make a longitudinal incision here, with
transverse incisions there, etc., etc.? No, we will
not; we will fall back to our old friend the diagram,
and if you cannot make yourself a set of false teeth
after that, then remain in heathen darkness on all
matters of dentistry, as you deserve. Cut a piece
of orange-peel in the shape represented, and at
the foot of the preceding diagram you will see how
they look when you put them on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>A friend of ours, who is an ardent admirer of
that great humorist of the plains, Artemus Ward,
has recently been edifying a large circle of private
friends with imitations of the celebrated showman.
He has had a wig and false nose made expressly for
this entertainment, by the aid of which adjuncts he
succeeds in establishing quite a respectable resemblance
to the grand original, as may be seen by his
portrait, which we have taken the trouble to get
engraved.</p>

<p>Most of the jokes are those of Artemus repeated
from memory. The more sober ones, we fancy, are
original. The lecture runs thus:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;Having recently
paid a visit to Salt Lake City, the great Mormon
capital, I think a short lecture on the subject may
prove instructive as well as amusing. Although I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
appear before you with the cap and bells, I would
have you understand that when I speak of matters
of fact I shall confine myself strictly to the truth.
You may, therefore, rely upon all I shall tell you
concerning the Mormons as being strictly true.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

</div>

<p>"When on the dock preparatory to start on my
voyage, I found myself surrounded by a large concourse
of people, who seemed perfectly willing that
I should go. 'Go along,' they said, 'old feller, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
stay as long as you please.' I would like you to
take a good look at the noble vessel in which I
sailed (pointing to a crude delineation of a steamship),
because, if you ever go to California, travel
by some other boat.</p>

<p>"When we were fairly out at sea, I observed that
many of the passengers ran frequently to look over
the side of the vessel&mdash;to see if there were any dolphins
alongside, I presume. One young couple
sitting near me, newly married and very haggard,
talked earnestly together. I could not avoid hearing
a part of their conversation.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Julia,' said the gentleman, 'you are very
noble; you have thrown up society, friends, everything
for me.'</p>

<p>"'Do not say a word, Alfred,' replied the young
lady; 'you have thrown up more than I have.'</p>

<p>"It was very touching, for they certainly threw
up a great deal between them.</p>

<p>"In San Francisco I delivered an oration. It
was not, perhaps, equal to Cicero's, but still I think&mdash;I
don't know&mdash;but I think if old Cis had heard
it he would have been astonished. I delivered an
oration to the soldiers once. They were much delighted&mdash;very
much delighted indeed&mdash;so delighted,
in fact, that they come dooced near shooting me.</p>

<p>"The hotels on the road to Salt Lake City are,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
as a rule, inferior to our leading ones in New York.
At one of them they gave me a sack of oats for a
pillow. That night I had nightmares. I suppose
they were attracted by the oats. The next morning
the landlord asked me how I was, <i>old hoss</i>! I replied
that I felt my oats!</p>

<p>"After travelling several days, more or less, we
reached Utah, and put up at this hotel (here a rude
picture is produced). It is a temperance hotel.
The only objection I have to temperance hotels is
that&mdash;that&mdash;they keep such dooced poor <i>licker</i>. In
the front of the hotel may be seen the coach in
which we had been confined for the last eight days.
Those among my audience who have served a term
in the State prison will understand our feeling
when we escaped from that vehicle.</p>

<p>"Utah is a beautiful city, laid out in broad streets,
with avenues of fine trees. Brigham Young is the
big injun of the place, next to whom comes Heber
Kimball. Brigham has the largest number of wives&mdash;two
hundred in all. He says his only hope now
is to have his dying pillow smoothed by the hands
of his family. Under the circumstances, it strikes
me he'd have to go out of doors to die if he wishes
to accomplish it.</p>

<p>"The number of his children is unknown, though,
if you multiply two hundred wives by fifteen, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
will get a rough estimate. We mentioned this to
Briggy, and he seemed to think it rather rough.
Perhaps so. Brig is very exact in his calculations;
he knows to a ton of beef what is consumed in his
household daily. As an illustration of his exceeding
accuracy in little matters, we may mention a
fact. On one occasion one of his wives was missing.
Five weeks had not elapsed before Brigham
had discovered the fact. Those of my audience who
have mothers-in-law will appreciate the advantage
of two hundred wives. There must be a good deal
of mother-in-law to that number; an amount highly
calculated to keep things lively. Possibly Brigham
is fond of excitement.</p>

<p>"On one occasion Briggy took a fancy to a
certain young lady, and proposed for her hand.
She replied that she could not accept his offer
unless he also married her elder sister. To this he
readily assented&mdash;went to her&mdash;the proposition was
made&mdash;the sister said she should be obliged to decline
unless he married her mother also. After
some deliberation he proposed to the mother, but
she refused unless he would also propose to her
old grandmother. Finally he married the whole
crowd.</p>

<p>"Of course Brigham cannot attend personally to
the amount of courting necessary&mdash;that is to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
in our old-fashioned style. No, he has his form of
love done up in pamphlet form, which he sends to
any lady to whom he wishes to be united. This
saves trouble.</p>

<p>"Though the Mormons generally are a very
steady people, they still have loose fish among
them. On one occasion a gay Mormon Lothario
gained access to a young ladies' seminary. In the
morning it was found he had eloped with the entire
establishment.</p>

<p>"I, even I did not escape without some difficulty.
Just before my departure, a worthy gentleman in
the pickle business died, leaving fourteen wives.
They sent for me. When I called I found them all
in tears.</p>

<p>"'Why is this thus?' I inquired.</p>

<p>"'Art going?' inquired they.</p>

<p>"'I ist,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Oh, why! oh, why goest thou?'</p>

<p>"'Because when I gettest ready to doest a thing,
I generally doest it,' replied I.</p>

<p>"'Wilt marry us?' said they.</p>

<p>"'I rather think not,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Oh, this is too much!' cried they.</p>

<p>"'That's where it is,' rejoined myself. 'It's precisely
on account of its being too much that I
object to it.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lectures were very popular at Salt Lake,
and always well attended. On one occasion I incautiously
gave a family ticket to a certain Elder.
That night my house was crowded to overflowing.
It was entirely filled with the Elder's family. There
was not room for a single paying visitor to come in.
The next day they called to say they were very
much pleased, and gave me their photograph in a
very pretty pocket-case, something like a wallet.
Subsequently it was taken out of my pocket by a
young man on Broadway, but I detected him in the
act and seized him by the collar. He at once
acknowledged the deed, but said he did it in the
name of the Confederate government in retaliation
for outrages committed by our troops in the Shenandoah
Valley."</p>

<p>Here the lecture ended. It generally received
nearly as much applause as that of the great original,
for my friend had studied Ward's peculiar manner
and quaint enunciation till he had got it to a
nicety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>This chapter we shall devote exclusively to a
little play, written expressly for parlor performance.
The characters are so few, and the materials&mdash;in
the way of dress and scenery&mdash;so simple, that it can
be easily gotten up in any household. In the full-page
picture you will see our idea of the "make-up"
of the Artist, but as Mr. Bullywingle does not
come out so well on so small a scale, we annex a
picture of his head and shoulders as a guide to the
reader. We feel disposed, however, to allow the
largest latitude to the performers as to make-up.
They can modify the dress of the characters according
to circumstances. Another reason we have for
giving the portrait of Mr. Bullywingle is, that a
large copy of it is required in the performance of the
piece. In copying this it is no matter how ludicrously
inaccurate your performance is, provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
you make the face fiery red, the hair white, and
the spectacles green. Indeed, the worse the picture
the funnier the effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Mr. Bullywingle.</i>&mdash;Hat&mdash;white, with black band.
Face very red, culminating in a bright crimson on
the nose. The face should be colored with vermilion,
which can be procured in a powdered state
at any color store. If you get it in this state mix
it with water, to which add a very small quantity
of gum or glue. The best plan, however, is, if convenient,
to purchase a cake of vermilion such as is
used for water-colors.</p>

<p>Hair, eyebrows, and moustache must be very
white. The hair and moustache can be made white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
by dressing with plenty of pomatum, and then
sprinkling them liberally with flour from the flour
dredger. The imperial and eyebrows should be
painted on the face with flake-white. Procure two
ounces of flake-white (in powder) in any paint store;
mix it carefully with water till it is about as thick
as molasses. A small piece of glue, about the
weight of two beans, should be dissolved in the
water before it is added to the flake-white.</p>

<p>Spectacles&mdash;green, which you can either borrow
from a friend, buy at a store, or steal anywhere.
If, however, you are too proud to steal, and you cannot
get the specs any other way, you may cut them
out of card-board and paint the proper color. As
Mr. Bullywingle wears his specs on the end of his
nose, never using them to look through, it is of
little consequence whether they be transparent or
not.</p>

<p>Cravat&mdash;large and white.</p>

<p>Shirt collar&mdash;large; can be cut out of writing-paper.</p>

<p>Coat&mdash;blue, with gilt buttons.</p>

<p>Vest and pants&mdash;light; the latter short in the
legs.</p>

<p>Shoes&mdash;low.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Puttyblow</i> (the artist).&mdash;Nose red; eyebrows
black, and painted above the natural eyebrows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
This gives the eyebrows a continued elevated appearance,
which is very comical in effect.</p>

<p>The moustache and beard can either be painted
with burnt cork or India-ink, or, which is far better,
made out of curled hair and a little diachylon, as
described in a previous chapter. If you wish to
make the character very comic, you can turn up
the nose with a piece of thread and stick a patch
of court-plaster over one of your teeth, all of which
has been described in earlier chapters.</p>

<p>Cap&mdash;something fancy, of bright color if possible.</p>

<p>Coat&mdash;anything comical and shabby. The young
man is poor.</p>

<p>Pants&mdash;short in the legs.</p>

<p><i>Miss MacSlasher</i> must be attired in walking costume,
and make herself look as elegant and pretty
as possible. Or in case the ladies won't act, or you
happen to be out of pretty girls, you can get Miss
MacSlasher up as an old lady, and make her look
as comical as you can. You see our play is on a
compensating, self-adjusting principle. Now we
will give you a list of all the things you will require
in the way of "properties," as they are called
in stage parlance. Before doing so, however, we
must impress upon you the necessity of having a
stage manager, otherwise you will surely get into a
state of confusion and spoil the play. It is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
duty of the stage-manager to collect the properties
together and see that they are all in their right
places. He will arrange the stage, and, if desirable,
act as prompter.</p>

<p>Vermilion&mdash;To be procured at a paint store.</p>

<p>Flake-white and green paint&mdash;paint store.</p>

<p>Card-board for imitation spectacles, and glue&mdash;paint
store.</p>

<p>Three or four camel's-hair pencils&mdash;paint store.</p>

<p>India-ink or burnt cork.</p>

<p>Pomatum, butter or lard for hair.</p>

<p>Ten cents' worth of diachylon (in lump form, not
plaster&mdash;remember this; also remember that the
diachylon must be warmed before the fire to make
it stick), which can be had at any drug store.</p>

<p>Flour for hair can be procured from the kitchen,
if the barrel ain't gin' out.</p>

<p>Green spectacles.</p>

<p>White cravat and large shirt-collar.</p>

<p>Blue or green coat, with bright buttons.</p>

<p>Vest and pantaloons, light in color.</p>

<p>Small piece of court-plaster or black silk, for
tooth.</p>

<p>Curled hair from stuffing of mattresses.</p>

<p>Cap for artist, of bright color.</p>

<p>Coat for artist.</p>

<p>Pants for ditto, legs short.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Slippers for ditto.</p>

<p>Large portrait of Mr. Bullywingle.</p>

<p>Easel or stand for portrait.</p>

<p>Palette (the palette should be cut out of pasteboard,
the cover of a large book, or something of
that kind&mdash;a wooden palette would break when sat
upon); a maul-stick and brushes, pictures, casts,
etc., to give the artist's studio an artistic appearance.</p>

<p>Stale hard loaf of bread.</p>

<p>Knife&mdash;palette knife if possible.</p>

<p>Tray with two cups.</p>

<p>Tea-pot containing very weak tea.</p>

<p>Plates, butter, and pieces of crockery, to make a
clatter.</p>

<p>Sheets, comfortable, shawls, or Turkey-red, to
make proscenium and drop-curtain.</p>

<p>Several sheets of tissue-paper, red and blue, to
ornament proscenium.</p>

<p>Lamps to light the stage.</p>

<p>Deeds and legal documents for Mr. Bullywingle.</p>

<p>Umbrella for Mrs. Bullywingle.</p>

<p>White hat with black band.</p>

<p>Towels, or rags, to cover and conceal artist's
breakfast on a chair.</p>

<p>Slice of bread prepared with diachylon or hooked
pins to stick to Mr. Bullywingle's coat-tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>



<h3>BULLYWINGLE THE BELOVED;</h3>

</table></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>An artist's studio.</i></p>

<p>Curtain rises, or is pulled down, and discovers
Mr. Puttyblow seated at an easel opposite a picture
which is so placed that the audience cannot see the
face of it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Puttyblow</i> (yawning). Oh&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;awe&mdash;awe&mdash;oo&mdash;oo!
Oh, thunder! Oh, pickled thunder,
turnip-tops, trust, tick, and tomatoes! I wish
to goodness, goose-pies, and the goddess of fame,
some one would give me a commission to paint
a picture&mdash;one thousand dollars&mdash;half cash in
advance, and the balance on completion of
the work&mdash;some grand heroic subject, which would
send my name and fame resounding through
the nations of the earth like the mighty avalanche
of the Alps, till the human race with one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
voice should stand back and exclaim&mdash;"That's
him!"</p>

<p>Now, I think I could paint a picture of Washington
Crossing the Delaware in a style of art equally
creditable to my feelings as an artist and an American
citizen. I'd make Washington&mdash;yes&mdash;I would
not make him as they generally do, in a great, big,
comfortable boat, with a new suit of clothes, looking
up to heaven, while a lot of other fellows are
shoving the boat through lumps of ice with hooks
and pikes, and things of that kind. No! I'd make
him swimming across, with the stars and stripes
between his teeth and a horse-pistol of the period
behind each ear. That's what I should call something
like a picture. But all this is vain; instead
of painting big pictures, and building my palatial
villa on the Hudson, I am stuck and starved in this
miserable chamber&mdash;a poor artist with scarcely
anything to feed upon but tobacco-smoke and my
own ideas. Talking about feed reminds me that I
have had no breakfast yet. Now breakfast is one
of those ideas about which I have my own ideas&mdash;namely,
to wit: that you can't continually do without
it&mdash;that's to say, not as a steady thing. It grows
monotonous after a time. That tea has been standing
three-quarters of an hour, and ought to be now
fit for human nourishment (pours out tea, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
quite colorless). Rather weak&mdash;I may even go so
far as to say exceedingly weak. It is like Hancock's
veterans, will stand any amount of fire for
any length of time without changing color. But
you are very weak, poor tea; like women, let us
respect your weakness. The butter is strong
enough to take care of you (smells butter). I wonder
whether this butter is not manufactured near
Forty-second street, N. Y. It strikes me I have
smelt something very like it near the soap factory
on the Hudson River Railroad. Where's the knife
(takes knife and loaf)? Ah! here it is (tries to cut
loaf, which resists all his efforts). This loaf is beginning
to get slightly obstinate. Most extraordinary
thing how hard a loaf becomes after you have
kept it for a week or two. However, I ain't the
kind of man to let any darned baker's bread&mdash;ever
baked&mdash;get the best of me. No! (Takes up
hatchet at one side, places bread on floor, and begins
chopping it. Cuts off a piece which he butters,
and lays upon a chair.) Now, Puttyblow, my boy;
you shall have bread and chops for breakfast.
C-h-e-o-p-s&mdash;chops! Chops with a large C. (A
loud knocking is heard at the door.) Oh, thunder!
there's some one at the door&mdash;it will never do to
let them see these things around (piles up cups
and saucers on tray and covers them with towels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
He leaves the slice of bread and butter, however, on
the chair). It doesn't look prosperous; and nobody
ever thinks anything of any one who isn't
prosperous. (Seats himself at easel, and pretends
to be busy painting.) Come in!</p>

<p class="center">Enter <i>Mr. Bullywingle.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Ha! I've found a refuge at last, thank
goodness! I'm all in a flutter&mdash;she nearly caught
me. It was a dooced close shave. Here am I tormented
to death by women who will insist upon
marrying me. 'Pon my soul it is rather too bad that
a man, because he is rather nice-looking and has a
little money saved up, cannot leave his house without
being pursued by all the women in creation
wanting to marry him. I don't want to marry <i>them</i>.
I don't see any particular fun in dividing all my property,
my time, my comfort, my amusement, with
another individual, besides giving that individual
the life-long privilege of&mdash;the life-long right to dictate
the temperature of the apartment in which I
sit, the amount of light which shall illuminate my
chamber; who shall be my associates; where I
shall live; what I shall eat; what I shall drink&mdash;there's
the rub! actually putting the power into the
hands of a mortal like yourself to come between
you and your social tod. Oh, it's horrible to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of! Marriage is a humbug. I wouldn't marry the
Bearded Lady herself. But I wonder what kind of
an office this is I've rushed into&mdash;not a lawyer's;
no&mdash;doesn't smell of Russia leather. Not a Government
office; no&mdash;don't smell any whiskey. Not
p-e-t&mdash;yes, r-o&mdash;l-e-u-m; there's certainly a smell
of oil around. Ah, oh&mdash;yes, I see; it's some kind
of a paint shop. I must trump up some business
with the proprietor as an excuse for coming in.
Wonder, by the way, whether there's anybody
about, after all? Ah! yes, to be sure; bless my
soul, there he is. (Takes a step towards artist, and
coughs. Artist pretends to be deeply engaged in
his art, and does not hear him.) Ahem! ahem!
wonder whether the poor creature is deef and dumb.
Ahem! ah, excuse me, sir, but&mdash;ah, that is fine day&mdash;ahem!
good-morning, sir.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Good-morning, sir.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> You are a painter, are you not, sir?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> That is my name&mdash;ah, that is to say, that
is my profession.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I want you to paint me a sign for my
store.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> A what, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> A sign. Jothan H. Bullywingle, wholesale&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Wholesale fiddlestick!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Wholesale dealer in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Sir, I would have you to understand that
I don't paint signs, sir. I am an artist&mdash;historical
and portrait delineator.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh, ah! yes, exactly; that's what I mean.
I want you to paint my portrait&mdash;Jothan H. Bullywingle,
wholesale&mdash;no, exactly as you were saying,
my portrait. (Aside)&mdash;By Jove, I&mdash;I'm in for it.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Would you like a full face?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (thoughtfully). Why, pretty full.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Or a side face?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh, yes&mdash;a side face.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Or a three-quarter face?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Yes, a three-quarter face. Yes, she was
a blue one, I think, this last one.</p>

<p><i>Artist</i> (prepares seat). Will you take a seat, Mr.
Bully&mdash;Bully&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Wingle.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Will you take a seat, Mr. Wingle?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Bully, sir.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Take a seat, Mr. Winglebully.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Yes, yes, certainly. (Aside&mdash;I'm regularly
stuck for a portrait.) Certainly, sir; though
you haven't got my name exactly right&mdash;not quite
correct, my young friend. My name is Bullywingle.
(Aside&mdash;The first one was purple and diamonds.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>[Mr. B. seats himself at opposite side of stage to
artist, who sits down and prepares to paint.]</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Will you smile, sir?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) Really, a very polite young man.
Thank you, I don't mind if I do&mdash;the least drop in
the world; Bourbon, or anything that's handy.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I mean, sir, will you be pleased to smile
with your mouth?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) With my mouth? Of course,
with my mouth. Does the young man fancy that I
propose to drink through my nose, like an elephant?
(Aloud.) Oh, yes, I'll smile with my
mouth, of course.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I perceive you do not understand me, sir.
I allude to the expression.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh! I'm perfectly familiar with the expression&mdash;perfectly
familiar with the <i>expression</i>.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Mr. Winglebully, I wish you to assume
an agreeable expression of countenance in order
that I may transfer your beautiful features to my
canvas in a manner satisfactory to yourself, myself,
and mankind generally.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh, ah! yes, certainly&mdash;exactly&mdash;to be
sure&mdash;bless my soul&mdash;yes. (Mr. B. grins in an exaggerated
manner).</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Ah&mdash;yes; that's it&mdash;that's it&mdash;just so.
A little to the left. I'm afraid&mdash;keep your head up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>&mdash;I
cannot give you a very long sitting to-day&mdash;I'm
so crowded with sitters. (Mr. B. forgets that he is
sitting for his portrait and begins to look very
melancholy and miserable.) I am obliged to&mdash;smile,
if you please. (Mr. B. starts and resumes
his exaggerated grin.) I'm obliged to fix certain
days and hours to receive my friends and patrons,
otherwise they&mdash;will you smile, if you please?&mdash;otherwise
they would not leave me a&mdash;will you
smile, if you please, sir? Look at me and think
of something pleasant. Think of a lady (Mr. B.
looks miserable and frightened). (Aside&mdash;He
doesn't look as if he were thinking of a lady, does
he?) Think of something pleasant, now&mdash;something
pleasing. Think of <i>Hash</i> (Mr. B. brightens
up). Yes, hash. Keep on thinking of hash, hash,
hash! Good gracious! will you smile, sir? Hash&mdash;hash&mdash;hash!
Keep smiling&mdash;hash&mdash;that's it;
hash! There, sir, will you be kind enough to look
at that? You are a little rough and raw (Mr. B.
starts), but, of course, I have only rubbed you in.
You will come out better at the second painting.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (rising and advancing towards the picture).
Oh, yes&mdash;yes, very good. The shirt-collar
and the cravat are extremely like; but don't you
think you might alter the rest?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Well&mdash;ah&mdash;umph! I don't know. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
think I have hit your eye exactly. (Mr. B. starts
slightly.) The hair is very fair, and I've got hold
of your nose very satisfactorily. (Mr. B. rubs his
nose.) The mouth might look all the better, perhaps,
for a little madder, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh, dear, no, it's quite mad enough. I
don't wish to have a severe expression of countenance.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I refer to the color&mdash;the pigment.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The color the pig meant. The pig&mdash;the
pig. I meant what I said, sir; and if you think to
call me a pig with impunity you are very much mistaken.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;no, my dear sir; you mistake
me. We artists use a beautiful pink color
called madder, and I spoke of this as a pigment&mdash;no
offence, not for the world. But allow me to
place the picture in a better light; you can hardly
judge of it in its present position. (Turns easel
and picture round facing the audience.) (Aside.)&mdash;Now
won't he be an unreasonable old polypus to
object to that as a likeness? (Aloud.)&mdash;There, sir,
now you can see it better. (They both sit down in
chairs, the artist on his own palette and Mr. B. on
the slice of bread and butter left by the artist.)</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Now, sir, I think I have caught the expression
of your eyes and spectacles; and as for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the nose, it literally speaks, while the chin and
mouth&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Yes&mdash;yes, but I don't think you have
stuck quite closely enough to nature. There is
nothing like sticking to a thing. (Rises and moves
towards picture, showing slice of bread sticking to
his coat-tails. Advances and examines picture
critically.)</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I declare, if the idiotic old grampus has
not been sitting down on my bread and butter. It
is most extraordinary that some people will never
look where they sit down. (Rises to remove bread
and butter, and shows palette sticking to his dressing-gown
behind.) The carelessness of some people
is marvellous&mdash;really astonishing.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The shirt-collar is certainly very like;
but don't you think the complexion is a little high?
because I am really rather pale, you know.</p>

<p><i>Artist</i> (making futile endeavors to remove the
bread and butter with one hand). Ah, yes, perhaps
that might be toned down a little. (Aside.) I'll
whitewash the old brute if he likes. (Aloud.) If
you will be kind enough to take a seat for two
minutes I will try to avail myself of your valuable
suggestion (looks around for his palette). Now,
where on earth can be my palette? (Looks suspiciously
at old Mr. B.) He can't have been sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
down on that too&mdash;and yet I do believe he's stupid
enough for anything. (Looks for palette again.)
No. (At this moment Mr. B. sits down on the
chair where Mr. P. has concealed his breakfast, and
everything goes with a crash.)</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> There goes that old porpoise again! All
my breakfast gone&mdash;my beautiful tea and my elegant
bread and butter. (To Mr. B., who apologizes.)
Ah, never mind, sir&mdash;no consequence;
only a few paint saucers, that's all. No consequence;
take a seat over here. (Seats old gent in
the chair which Mr. B. first occupied, and which
artist has since used.) But my palette&mdash;where can
it have gone? Where's that d&mdash;d palette? Let
me see; I think I laid it on that chair. Will you
kindly rise for one moment, Mr. Winglebully?
(Looks at Mr. B.'s back.) No! strange&mdash;let me
see&mdash;oh! ah! yes&mdash;I&mdash;he sat over there. (A
thought seems to have struck him. He begins to
feel behind his own coat, where he finds the palette.
Produces it&mdash;his own fingers covered with paint.)
There it is&mdash;I knew I'd put it somewhere. (Here
a knocking is heard at the door. Mr. B. jumps up
and grasps the artist by the hand, getting his own
covered with paint in the operation.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Here she is! For heaven's sake, conceal
me!</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> The blue woman.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> The blue woman?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Yes&mdash;they pursue me wherever I go.
It's a blue woman now. Yesterday it was a red
woman. Oh, all sorts of women&mdash;black women&mdash;green
women&mdash;white women&mdash;for pity's sake, conceal
me! They'd make a Mormon or polygamist
of me. (Wipes his painted fingers over his face.)
Oh, my dear sir, you would not have me commit
trigamy&mdash;you would not&mdash;but hide me somewhere&mdash;hide
me!</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Here&mdash;here, behind the curtain.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lady</i> enters.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Is there a gentleman here?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Em&mdash;ah! gentleman? no&mdash;no; that is
to say, not exactly.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> This is an artist's studio, is it not?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Yes, madam; this is an artist's studio.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> There is no other studio in this building?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> This is the only studio in this building.
Will you take a seat, madam?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> I was to meet an elderly gentleman here&mdash;my
father&mdash;who was going to have his portrait
taken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) Her father&mdash;that's a deep dodge.
Pretends to be after her father, the artful thing.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Yes, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> He should have been here some time
ago&mdash;that is to say, if I have come to the right
place.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Ah, yes; this is the right place. (Aside.)
Hooray! here's another job.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) Send her away! send her away!
Ah, you villain, are you going to betray me?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> You seem to have a great many pretty
pictures here.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Ah&mdash;oh&mdash;well, a few little trifles. Are
you fond of art?</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Oh, yes&mdash;very.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I shall be happy to show you some of my
sketches. If you will excuse me for a moment, I
will bring them from the other room.</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i> Certainly, It will give me great pleasure
to look at anything in the shape of pictures. I
once studied Poonah Painting and Potichomanie myself;
and mamma's uncle, who was a great artist,
and used to draw things with a red-hot poker, said
he couldn't tell my pictures from life, almost&mdash;only
I could never learn to do trees. Don't you find
trees very difficult? Mamma's uncle used to say
the only fault with my trees was that they looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
like cabbages. I can paint cabbages very well; but
then they don't look pretty in a picture, you know.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Indeed, I doubt not your delicate hand
would lend a charm to any object it might portray.
Nature is full of beauties, and there is a world of
loveliness even in a cabbage.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) In a cabbage-head.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> But I will bring you my portfolio&mdash;a few
unworthy sketches which may serve to while away
the moments till the arrival of your estimable
father.<br />
<span class='stgdir'>[Exit.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (aside.) Good heaven! He is going to
keep me here all day while he makes a fool of himself
to that young woman. This will never do! I
must escape. I must throw myself on her mercy.
She has an awful vicious expression of countenance,
though. However, she must have the heart of a
woman. Perhaps she has a brother; and how
would she like to have him married against his will
by fifteen women in blue? I will&mdash;yes, I will
throw myself on her mercy. I will implore her to
spare me. Poor thing! I shall be sorry to break her
heart&mdash;but it must be done.&mdash;&mdash;Courage, Bullywingle&mdash;courage!
(Rushes out and throws himself
at her feet.) My good young woman, spare
me! Think of your own brother, and spare me!<br />

<p>I cannot marry you all. If I did marry you I
should make the red lady miserable for life, and
the green lady would die of jealousy, and the yellow
lady might commit suicide.</p>

<p class="center">Enter <i>Artist</i>, with portfolio, which falls on the floor.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> You venerable reptile, what are you

I'll knock you down, sir! You've driven away one
of my best customers. (They scuffle.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> But my dear sir&mdash;my good young friend,
what was I to do? Hear me&mdash;listen&mdash;leave go&mdash;you'll
tear my coat&mdash;let go, or she'll be back, and
then I'm lost! Do you hear, you rascal! You'll
tear my coat&mdash;there go my suspenders&mdash;there goes

to do grievous bodily battery and commit violent
matrimony&mdash;let go!</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> You old rascal&mdash;you old polypus&mdash;you old
humbug&mdash;you are ruining me! (Rushes to one

Old gent strikes an attitude with umbrella.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Come on, Mac what's your name! and
damned be he who first cries hold&mdash;enough!</p>

<p><i>Artist</i> (aside). I'll be hanged if the old buffer
ain't swearing! (Aloud.) By all the powers I'll be
revenged! As sure as my name is Puttyblow I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
will be re-ve-n-ged! (Is about to rush at old
gent.)</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Pause, rash man! Did you say Puttyblow?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I did.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Have you a strawberry mark on your left
arm?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Nature has ornamented me in the manner
you describe.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Are you short-sighted in your left eye?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Such is my affliction.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Do you snore at nights?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> So I have been informed by the people
over the way, who have sent over several times to
expostulate with me in the most offensive terms
possible.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> And sleep late in the morning?</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> (rushing forward.) My long-lost son!</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Excuse me for one moment. Have you
a gooseberry bush on your left arm?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Gooseberry? No&mdash;no&mdash;not specially.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Do you wear corns or paper collars?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well, I've had chilblains.</p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Are you subject to hydrophobia?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well, not precisely; but I've been run
over by a Broadway omnibus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Artist.</i> Are you in the habit of committing suicide?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Then you have a father?&mdash;wonderful!

No, not niece; cousin&mdash;second cousin&mdash;oh, hang the

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>It may be remembered that in a recent chapter
we mentioned being in a <i>tranquil mood</i>, and, while
in that condition, calling on our friend Nix, and
further, that Nix introduced us that same evening
to some ladies with brown eyes.</p>

<p>Since that event the <i>tranquil</i> moods have come
over us periodically, with rapidly increasing virulence.
So much so that latterly we have found it
desirable to dispense with the cumbrous ceremony
of going round to call for Nix. The fact is we have
taken a great fancy to <i>that</i> boy Little Pickle; he is
certainly a very fine boy.</p>

<p>It occurs to us at this moment that we have not
yet given a name to this family. Their real name
is one of those which recall old revolutionary times
directly it is uttered. One of those names which,
to ourself at least, at once summons up a picture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
marching ranks of men in three-cornered hats and
yellow breeches, toiling forward with glistening
muskets over their shoulders, past rows of quaint
gabled houses. We cannot give the real name, of
course&mdash;that is out of the question&mdash;so we will
call them Adams, because that is not their name.
Then we will subdivide them as follows: Mrs.
Adams, Bud, Blossom, and Berry. We christen
them thus because these were the titles they received
in a little floral and pomological game we
once played.</p>

<p>The Adams family were going to give a party.
We were called in as consulting engineer, to suggest
attractions. We readily accepted the office.
The reader knows our system and will easily guess
our first order. Objects to provoke conversation!</p>

<p>Pig made out of lemon. Good! The pig was
made and applauded.</p>

<p>"But," suggested Bud, "why confine ourselves
to a pig; surely we can make something else."</p>

<p>"Surely," we assented. So all of us set our wits
to work at zoology.</p>

<p>Bud made the first discovery. "Oh!" she exclaimed,
"I have found out something beautiful&mdash;a
whole litter of little pigs to go with the lemon!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/i_209a.jpg" width="448" height="139" alt="" title="" />

<img src="images/i_209b.jpg" width="437" height="336" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>And, indeed, 'twas true. In a few seconds she
had some almonds soaking in a cup of boiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
water. In a few seconds more she was peeling off
their brown jackets, revealing the smooth white
nut, as white as the tips of her own taper fingers.
The almonds were soon converted into sucking-pigs,
and were admitted on all hands to look quite
cunning, and as natural as nature, with their little
white bodies
grouped
round the
maternal lemon&mdash;some
running, some standing, and some seated
on their haunches.</p>

<p>We need not explain to the gifted reader the
<i>modus operandi</i>. It is much the same as with the
lemon, only the eyes are dotted with a black lead
pencil and the
ears are made
from small
slips of wood.</p>

<p>Stimulated
by the success
of Bud, Blossom
dived
down into the
depths of her imagination, and fished out a goat.
The goat was unquestionably a triumph. The
body consisted of a pear, the head of an unbleached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
almond, the legs, horns, and beard of raisin
stalks.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_210a.jpg" width="134" height="160" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/i_210b.jpg" width="362" height="336" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>On the same principle, and with wonderful
celerity, Berry took up the idea, gracefully acknowledged
her indebtedness to the original inventor,
and produced a deer&mdash;a deer with wide-spreading
antlers made of raisin stalks,
and legs of the same material, which
counterfeited nature even to the knee-joints.
The neck cost some little mental
exertion, but was finally triumphed
over in the following shape, neatly cut out of wood.</p>

<p>The deer now appeared truly a monarch of the
forest; a little
weak in the
shoulders perhaps,
and rather
full-chested
behind, but
still a noble
animal.</p>

<p>Not to be
outdone with
her own idea,
Blossom wrestled vigorously with her subject, and
ere we had ceased admiring the deer, had very
nearly completed a sheep&mdash;a sheep so fleecy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
short in the legs that it was at once voted the
greatest triumph of all, though <span class="smcap">WE</span> personally
and privately
thought, and
still think,
that, for true
genius, Bud's
idea of the
pigs far exceeded
any of
them. The white almond certainly made a most
admirable sheep's head, but then apple, of which
the body was made, grew rapidly rusty when once
peeled&mdash;so much so that we had to scrape our
sheep once or twice in the course of the evening
to restore its fleeciness.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_211a.jpg" width="448" height="326" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_211b.jpg" width="448" height="137" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Having made large herds of deer, flocks of goats
and sheep, not to mention litters of pigs, we disposed
some of them on the mantel-piece and what-nots,
while others were reserved to make a grand
pastoral scene on the supper table. Having finished
these, we devoted our energies to constructing
scent-bags and
mice, the latter
made out of apple-seeds,
as described in a previous chapter.
Here the transcendent genius of Bud again as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>serted
itself&mdash;she invented a rat; a rat made out
of an unbleached almond. When grouped with the
mice and flour-sacks the effect was truly grand.</p>

<p>What now?</p>

<p>"What shall we make next?" was the general
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, can't you make something that will jump
up?" eagerly suggested Little Pickle, who had kept
pretty quiet during our zoological researches.</p>

<p>"Can't you make something that will jump up?"
This was so vague that we were fain to demand
further light.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know at our school one of the boys
made a kind of thing with a bit of wax that jumped
up and frightened you."</p>

<p>This was still far from clear, but whatever it
might be, it was evidently calculated to frighten
somebody, and so was immediately voted down by
the ladies.</p>

<p>"Oh, make that gorilla portrait, you know,"
again entreated Little Pickle; "that makes such
fun."</p>

<p>This proposition, though received coolly, was,
nevertheless, discussed at some length, till Blossom
called her sister's attention to the fact that one of
their invited guests would be a certain Dr. O'Tang,
who really did resemble a gorilla, and should the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
glass fall into his hands, he would feel hurt at the
joke; so Little Pickle's second proposition was
voted down.</p>

<p>We now felt a heavy weight of responsibility
hanging on our shoulders. Six brown eyes were
resting upon us, each as deep and brown as a
mountain pool.</p>

<p>"Can we not do something with paper?" suggested
Bud, her exquisite genius again coming to
our aid. This suggestion gave us the cue.</p>

<p>"I have it," we exclaimed; "I will teach you
to make stained glass. To be sure, it is only a variation
of your own beautiful art of making transparencies;
still, if you have never heard of the
process, it may afford some amusement, and help
you to decorate your rooms."</p>

<p>One apartment in the house of Adams was of
the kind known as <i>extension room</i>. The two windows
which separated this apartment from the back
parlor served admirably to exhibit the new art.
The object of the process is to produce an effect
somewhat similar to the heraldic painting on the
casements of old European houses, and is done
thus:</p>

<p>You procure several sheets of tissue paper of
various colors, a pair of scissors, and some fine
boiled paste. You fold a sheet of the paper twice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
then cut out of the folded paper a form&mdash;say, for
example, like the
one on the left:
so that when
the sheet is
open there will
be two pieces
like the one on
the right.</p>

<p>Paste one of
these in the centre of the window-pane you wish to
decorate, then paste the other over it, only lapping
over a little on one
side and below, as represented
in this diagram.</p>

<p>When this is dry it will
have a very pretty effect.
Of course you can cut the
papers in any form you
choose and have them in
different colors&mdash;red over
green, or yellow over blue. You may also stitch
one pattern of a smaller size right in the centre of
another, or paste three or four different patterns
one above the other, as illustrated by our subjoined
cuts.</p>

<p>Having delivered our short lecture (illustrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
with examples) to the six brown eyes, and also to
the six white ears&mdash;like quaint sea-shells from the
shores of Elysium&mdash;we all proceeded to operate on
the windows before mentioned, and
we are glad to say with the most
pleasing results.</p>

<p>Our scissorings with the colored
paper brought to light an accomplishment
of Little Pickle, which set us
all to work anew with scissors and pen and ink for
some time.</p>

<p>Master Adams's system was this: he took a small
piece of writing paper, and dropping a minute
quantity of ink in the centre, then folded it right
across the blot and rubbed it over with his finger.
When the paper was opened it displayed some
curious form or another. This, with
a few touches of the pen, we generally
made to resemble some object in nature.
Bud made an excellent stag's
head on one occasion, which we subjoin.</p>

<p>But Little Pickle's course of instruction did not
stop with blots. He folded bits of paper and cut
them into grotesque patterns, and set us all to
filling them up with pictures. The great art consisted
in making your design conform to the outline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of the paper. One of these, which we happened
to have brought away by accident, we have here
engraved. It was drawn by Bud, and is really very
clever.</p>

<p>That was a very delightful evening we passed
with the Adams's. Little
Pickle is a very fine boy;
guess we will call for him
on our road up in the
afternoon&mdash;to go skating.</p>

<p>That night, when we
reached home, we found
Nix had called and left us
a very curious work&mdash;<i>The
Veda, or the Sacred Writings
of the Hindoos</i>. We
slept sweetly, and dreamed we were reclining on
the banks of the Ganges conversing pleasantly
with Brahma. Singular dream, was it not?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Blue and white Christmas, with his henchman,
Santa Claus, having come and gone, leaving behind
him, however, for a while, his raiment of white and
blue, with a host of dear memories for our hearts'
nourishment through the next twelvemonth's stage
in this journey of life, we think we cannot better
show our appreciation of his goodness than by
painting a portrait of that small fraction of the universal
jollity which fell to our individual lot.</p>

<p>We have some friends who live in the country, a
long way from sidewalks and gas and railroads, or
at least far enough off to debar the dear souls from
many tastes of city pleasures. So, as these friends
cannot well go to town for amusement, and as they
have a large love of fun and several small children,
they try to bring amusements home on all festive
occasions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>To this house, with a small party of mutual acquaintances,
we went our way on the twenty-fifth
of December last. Before starting there were great
business operations to be performed, and such a
time as we had of it! One item was easily
managed, and caused no mental anxiety. We went
<i>en masse</i> to Ridley's, and, after waiting in a crowd
of crinoline for some time, came away each with his
dexter coat-pocket swelled out with a pound package
of mixed candies. That, of course, was simple
enough; but when it came to buying something
else&mdash;something of a more durable nature&mdash;then
our ingenuity was, indeed, put to the test. It will
be seen that our task was no ordinary one. There
were three of us, and we each wished, according to
our annual custom, to present each member of the
family with some appropriate gift; and as there
were five in the family, namely&mdash;papa, mamma,
daughter aged eleven, son aged four, and another
daughter aged two, and assuming that we each only
gave one object to each of the individuals in the
country house, it would make&mdash;three fives are fifteen&mdash;fifteen
different objects to be purchased,
every one of which ought to differ from the other,
besides being unlike anything they would be already
likely to possess. When we came to compare
notes, we found that we had, to a man, privately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and separately resolved to present papa with a
meerschaum pipe; two out of the three had thoughts
of giving mamma a dressing-case; while the unanimity
on the subject of work-boxes, dolls, and jumping-jacks
was really marvellous.</p>

<p>But we must not linger around fancy-stores, and
over candy counters, and in city streets. We have
a long evening before us away off in the country,
over miles of snowy roads. It is enough that, by
the aid of a steaming locomotive, which whizzed
and buzzed and thundered us through the lonely
snow-clad cuttings, as though it were saying:
"Come along! come along! come along! Hurry
up! Pish! phew! Here's another stoppage!
Clear the track! Don't keep us waiting!" stopping
only now and then, stock still, to brighten up
the mean way-station into a glow of mysterious
grandeur, with fitful flashes of light, as though it
were some monster fire-fly of the season. By
means of this lusty bug at first, and afterwards by
a rickety, ramshackle, old shandradan of a hack,
tortured along by two horses, one of which was
balky, we reached the house of our entertainers,
where the light streamed out through the red curtains
to meet us, and glorified the snow in our
path long before we pulled up at the hospitable
door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Merryweather both greeted us
heartily before we had kicked the snow from our
boots; while the former, with a celerity equally
creditable to his head and legs, dashed into the
kitchen, and reappeared with three smoking glasses
of hot brandy-punch.</p>

<p>"Here, boys," he cried, "take this. It will keep
the cold out. Come, I insist upon it."</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley and other good people tell us that it
is all wrong to drink spirituous liquors, and we are
not quite clear ourself as to the propriety of the
practice. But there was something genial in the
thoughtful attention of our friend Merryweather,
and something else grateful in the aroma of the
brandy-punch, that certainly made us all feel more
truly welcome and happy than had we been politely
shown up-stairs to wash our hands in a cold bedroom,
with the prospect of two doughnuts and a
cup of weak tea to follow.</p>

<p>Aunty Delluvian was of the party, being a very
old friend of the family. With regard to the company
generally, it may be defined as mixed. Some
of the children, whose parents were neighbors, betrayed
their status by the excess of starch and
bright colors which characterized their dresses;
while others from the city displayed all the ostentatious
simplicity of cultivated taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather opened the entertainment with
an exceedingly well intentioned, though rather
transparent, display of prestidigitation (if that is the
way to spell the abominable word); but as most of
his tricks depended upon the use of a new and complete
set of conjuring apparatus he had purchased
for the occasion, we will not linger over his magic
rings and dice and cups. Two items, however, in
his performance being attainable by very simple
means, we will describe.</p>

<p>At one stage in the entertainment it seemed absolutely
necessary that he should have the aid of a
small boy, in order to make six copper cents pass
from under a hat to the top of a bird-cage. Making
known his want, a red-faced youth with black curly
hair volunteered his services. The juvenile, be it
observed, had rendered himself somewhat conspicuous
by declaring at the end of every trick
that he knew how it was done, and by inquisitively
desiring to inspect the interior of goblets
and the bottoms of boxes. Merryweather's eyes
twinkled as this gentleman tendered his assistance.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, producing a small trumpet,
"this is my magic horn. Take it in your right
hand, till I say: 'Heigh! presto! pass!' Then, if
your lungs are strong enough, and you blow with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
sufficient force, those six cents will pass from under
the hat to the top of that cage yonder."</p>

<p>The youth took his stand firmly, looked knowingly,
and placed the trumpet to his lips confidently.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked Mr. Merryweather.
"Then, heigh! presto! pass!"</p>

<p>In an instant the face of the bold volunteer, black
hair, red cheeks, and all, were white as the driven
snow; and comic enough he looked, as he gaped
round with a chap-fallen expression, puzzled beyond
measure to know into what condition he had
blown himself. He had, in truth, blown himself all
over flour, the trumpet being constructed for that
special purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_223a.jpg" width="448" height="247" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>This instrument is very simple. You first procure
a tube of tin, or wood, or card-board, of about
two inches in diameter. A box of the desired
shape can be found in the store of almost any druggist,
or in default of that, a wide-mouthed vial can
be made to answer. The next thing required is a
thin tube, for which a piece of elder or a stick of
maccaroni will answer. These, with a large cork
or bung, are all the materials that are required.
Having cut a slice off the cork of about half an inch
in thickness, you fit it tightly into the centre of the
large tube; then cut another slice of the cork to fit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
into one end of the tube; but, before fixing it, cut
some notches round the edge, and make a hole in
the centre large enough to hold firmly the smaller
tube. Now fix the smaller tube in the second cork,
so that it will extend about two-thirds of the way
down one of the compartments in the larger tube;
fix the second cork (the one with the notches in it)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in the mouth of the large tube, and the trumpet is
made. By referring to the diagram, you will probably
get a better idea of the construction of this
weapon than from our description.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_223b.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When you wish to use the instrument, pour flour
through the notches you have cut in the cork, and
it is ready. Any one blowing sharply through the
small tube will, of course, blow all the flour in his
own face.</p>

<p>The second item in Mr. Merryweather's entertainment
we propose to describe is still more simple.
One of his feats consisted in burning a hole
in a pocket-handkerchief. To do this he required fire,
so he ordered his assistant to bring in a candle, which
was accordingly done, the candle being already
lighted. As soon as Mr. Merryweather cast his
eyes upon the luminary, he feigned to fly into a
terrible passion, roundly rating the unfortunate
attendant for presenting him with such a miserable
fag-end of an old kitchen dip. Then taking the
candle from the candlestick, he held the wretched
stump up to the audience, and appealed to them
whether it was not disgraceful that he, the great
Wizard of the Western World, should be presented
with such a paltry luminary.</p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "I could eat a dozen such
for lunch!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>And, suiting the action to the word, blew out the
light, and popped the offending morsel in his mouth,
and quietly munched it up.</p>

<p>A subdued cry of horror echoed through the
apartments, above which was heard the exclamation
of Aunty Delluvian:</p>

<p>"If the man isn't crunching his candle!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="485" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>To those not familiar with it, this trick is certainly
startling. The truth is that the candle in
question is made out of a piece of apple, with a
small peg cut from a nut or almond for a wick.
The almond wick will light readily, and burn brightly
for some time, so that the deception is perfect.
These diagrams will show the form in which to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
cut the candle and the wick, No. 1 representing the
candle in its completed state, and No. 2 the wick
before it is inserted.</p>

<p>The great wizard having completed his performances
and retired into private life, even to the
extent of handing cake round to the ladies and
drinking a glass of wine himself, he mingled freely
with the throng, but did not, however, unbend immediately,
but smiled condescendingly when the
ladies expressed admiration and surprise at the
supernatural powers he had just displayed.</p>

<p>Aunty Delluvian continued to evince considerable
disgust at our friend for eating the tallow candle,
a feeling which found vent in utterance of the monosyllables:</p>

<p>"Finn! The Finn! The Finn!"</p>

<p>This good Aunty favored us with a narrative
concerning an uncle of hers, who was a sea-captain,
and once made a voyage to "Moscow!" It
was a peculiarity, be it observed, of Aunty Delluvian,
that she appeared to have uncles ready at
hand for all emergencies. She told us that this
uncle, when at the Sclavonic capital, invited some
Russian officers on board his ship to dine. The
dinner was of the most sumptuous description, but
the Muscovites seemed to take but little interest in
the repast, until something on deck happened to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>call the host up-stairs; on his return he found all the
guests looking more cheerful. They chatted pleasantly
until the party broke up; and then, and not
till then, he discovered that his friends, during his
absence, had drunk all the oil out of the lamps,
eaten six boxes of candles stowed away under the
table, and had even devoured the shaving-soap off
his dressing-table.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="600" height="676" alt="THE HEADLESS BODY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE HEADLESS BODY.&mdash;<i>See page</i> <a href="#Page_209">209</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>We had a faint recollection of having heard this
story before, and quite pleased Aunty Delluvian by
telling her so; she considered it quite a tribute to
her uncle's popularity.</p>

<p>The second feature of the evening's programme
was of a less cheerful character than the first,
consisting of the display of a no more pleasing
object than a bodyless head. Our illustration on
next page will at once place the scene before our
readers, bereft, however, of some of the grim features
of the real spectacle; for, as we beheld it,
there was the real flesh tint, and the eyes rolled
fearfully.</p>

<p>Startling and complete as is the illusion in this
case, it is very simply managed. Get some person
with a high forehead and tolerably long hair, and
paint under the eyes a pair of eyebrows, and on the
forehead a nose and pair of moustaches, as represented
in the annexed cut. Then make the person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
lie down on his back under a table, in such a way
that you can arrange a curtain so as to conceal all
the body and half the face. Brush the hair out to
resemble a beard, and you have a perfect representation
of a bodyless head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="336" height="376" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>For painting the moustaches and eyebrows, Indian-ink
or burnt cork will answer.</p>

<p>There is one advantage which the spectacle can
boast of: it affords the ladies an opportunity for
giving those sweet little musical shrieks which are
so charming, and of being frightened generally&mdash;some
ladies look very bewitching when they are
frightened&mdash;besides giving ladies an excuse for
clinging to gentlemen's arms, which is very pleasant
for the gentlemen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather now introduced to our notice
a young gentleman who was detailed to amuse us
with some specimens of ventriloquism. We had no
notion before this time, when our attention was
particularly drawn to the subject, how much suitable
action has to do with ventriloquial illusions. As
performed before us by the young gentleman in
question, whose name was Noddles, the deception
was capital; but when the sounds were reproduced
in a private room, without action, for our special
instruction, we marvelled that any one could have
been deluded by them. First of all, Mr. Noddles
imitated the drawing of a cork. To give effect to
this, he turned his back to the audience, and feigned
to have a bottle between his knees. The method
of doing this is so simple that we think we can
almost describe it in words. First you make three
or four chirps in succession, such as people are in
the habit of making to birds; this sounds like driving
in the corkscrew. Then you place your fore-finger
in your mouth, and force it out so as to make
a loud pop, which signifies that the cork is drawn.
Then you smack your lips together, producing a
sound something like "Pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop"
rapidly, to imitate the wine bubbling from
the bottle. <i>Voil&agrave; tout!</i></p>

<p>After that, Mr. Noddles pretended to call to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
mason up the chimney, the mason answering in a
husky voice from above, and finally proceeding with
his work of knocking out a brick. The knocking
was produced much in the same way as the pouring
out the wine, by parting the lips suddenly; only, in
the case of the brick, the note was in a deeper key,
more resembling "Bubp&mdash;bubp&mdash;bubp&mdash;bubp." We
noticed particularly that when the performer addressed
the person up the chimney, he spoke with especial
clearness, delivering the words, as much as possible,
from the lips. This was in order to produce a
strong contrast to the tones of the man up the
chimney, which were produced far down in his own
throat.</p>

<p>Another of his performances was to pretend that
a dog was under the lounge, which refused to come
out, and finally bit him when he tried to drag it out
by the leg.</p>

<p>Still another consisted in imitating a man outside
the door trying to force it open. Sometimes
the supposed man would succeed in forcing the
door a short way, when a gush of his loud voice
would rush in, to be immediately cut short by the
sudden closing of the door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" width="510" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Noddles concluded his part of the entertainment
by the performance of the jumping rabbit&mdash;the
rabbit on this occasion being made out of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>lady's fur cuff tied up with a piece of string. This
crude counterfeit of bunny he laid on the palm of
his left hand, with one end resting against his fingers,
as represented in the cut, while with the
other hand he stroked and caressed it, saying at the
same time, "Be still, bunny&mdash;don't run away; if
you run away the dogs will catch you, and you will
be made into chicken-pie, and your skin will be
made into a fur cap and sold in the Bowery to&mdash;hallo!
hold on! hi!" the latter exclamations being
elicited by the rabbit jumping up his arm, while he
struggled to capture it and bring it back with his
right hand. The first jump made by the rabbit was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
produced by a sharp jerk of the fingers, which
sometimes sends him flying into the middle of the
room with a most lifelike effect.</p>

<p>But now a more imposing portion of the programme
claims our attention. A subdued jingling of
bells is heard at the door, a few spasmodic bumps,
and in trots the patron saint of the day&mdash;good
Santa Claus, sleigh, reindeer, red cap, and all. (See
next page.) It may not have been polite, but we
could not help it, and greeted the good saint with
an unrestrained roar of laughter. Surely never before
was seen out of Noah's Ark such a comical
steed, such legs, such proportions, and such a dislocated
style of locomotion. No matter, he amused
us more than a whole troop of the veritable article
from Spitzbergen; and, as a simple act of justice
between man and beast, we must admit that he
propelled Santa Claus and his turn-out in a most
efficient, not to say intelligent, style around the
room. This was the Merryweather substitute for a
Christmas-tree. Santa Claus came to distribute
the Christmas-gifts&mdash;a task he performed with a
discretion beyond his years. It is pleasing to
record that no one, not even the dullest in the
company, recognised Master Georgy in his disguise;
but one and all, with admirable tact, feigned
to be completely taken in, and fully believed that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>they were receiving a visit from the good saint
himself.</p>

</div>

<p>After the <i>vulgaris pueris</i>, the <i>elephant</i>, and other
specimens of zoology, it is almost needless to explain
how the reindeer was constructed. Our illustration
seems almost superfluous; still, something
may be made a little clearer by them; and to them
we refer the reader who wishes to learn how to
build a reindeer. In the case before us, the hide of
the deer was made out of a pair of army blankets,
purchased by Merryweather for five dollars in
Chambers street&mdash;about the best material that
could possibly be selected for the purpose. These
he cut out and fitted himself, and had them sewed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on his wife's sewing-machine. The head and horns
were made of thick brown paper, and here is the
most difficult part of the animal to describe&mdash;not
the most difficult to make, bear in mind. We hate
long explanations, and yet we feel puzzled now, as
we have often been before, to tell you how to make
this reindeer mask. However, here goes: You
require two or three sheets of thick brown paper, a
bowl of paste (flour and water boiled), and a block
of wood, from the wood-pile, of about six or seven
inches in diameter. (See annexed cut.) You moisten
one sheet of the paper slightly, and then mould
it over the block; having done this, you smear the
entire surface with paste, and mould another sheet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>of paper over that; then you smear the second
sheet over with paste, and mould a third sheet over
all; then let them stand till dry. This, when dry,
can be removed from the block, and will give you a
hollow cone on which you can paint the eyes and
mouth of the deer, and to which you can likewise
paste the horns, as indicated in this diagram. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
may strike you that the diagram looks more like a
bottle-nosed shark than the face of any denizen of
the forest. You must not, however, be discouraged
on this account; it will look all right when you get
it in its proper place.</p>

<p>Need we add, that after this we had supper;
when good-humor culminated in the grand old
song of "Auld Lang Syne," all singing and joining
hands round the table, down even to the little two
and a half year old Dolly, whose <i>auld lang syne</i> dated
no further back than two strawberry seasons. The
idea of taking a "richt gude wully wut" with such
a wee mite of a thing was so very comic that we all
laughed right merrily, while Mrs. Merryweather,
with tears in her eyes, clasped the child to her
bosom as though she would protect it from some
impending danger, possibly the approach of the
monster "richt gude wully wut."</p>

<p>The ladies and children retired. And we gentlemen
soothed our excited nerves with a quiet cigar
in Mr. Merryweather's library.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>We shall now amuse the fireside with a little
song, or rather we will try to tell our friends how to
gladden their own chimney-corners with the songs
of birds through the long winter evenings. It will
be pleasant when the wind is howling without
among the snow-laden limbs of the trees, to be
reminded of the gay summer by the counterfeit
notes of the woodland songsters. Still, we must
warn our readers, that to acquire the art thoroughly
needs patience and perseverance; we can but
tell them how to make and use the instrument, and
the rest they must learn for themselves. First look
at the annexed diagram, and then procure a leek
and cut off from the green leaf thereof a piece about
the size of the diagram; then lay it on a smooth
table, and with the thumb-nail delicately scrape
away a semicircular patch of the green pulpy sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>stance
of the leaf (as represented in the diagram),
being careful to leave the fine membrane or outer
skin of the leaf uninjured&mdash;and there is the instrument
complete. It may require several experiments
to make the first one, but once having discovered
the right way, they are very easily manufactured.
The reader may not be aware of the fact that the
leaf of the leek has a fine transparent outer skin
which is quite tough, but by breaking and carefully
examining one or two leaves, he will soon find out
to what we allude.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/i_242.jpg" width="448" height="148" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The way of using this instrument is to place it in
the roof of the mouth with the side on which is the
membrane downwards; then press it gently in its
place with the tongue, and blow between the tongue
and the upper teeth. After the first two or three
attempts, you will be able to produce a slight sound
like a mild grunt; then as you practise it you will
find that you can prolong and vary the sound somewhat,
so that in the course of a couple of days you
can imitate the barking of a dog and the neighing
of a horse. With two or three weeks' practice, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
will be able to imitate some of the song-birds; but
to produce exact counterfeits of the best singing-birds
will probably require months of study; the
result, however, will reward you for all your pains;
for certainly to be able to carry a mocking-bird,
canary, thrush, cat-bird, and sucking-pig in your
vest-pocket is no small accomplishment.</p>

<p>When not using the instrument, it should be kept
in a glass of water to prevent its drying.</p>

<p>Those <i>tranquil moods</i> of which we have twice
spoken come over us with still increasing frequency.
Little Pickle is certainly a very smart
boy. We are giving him lessons in drawing; he
comes on rapidly, but requires a great deal of attention.
Our time passes peaceably enough in study
and contemplation. Nix has procured us some
more works of Brahminical lore. It is a curious
religion, that of the Hindoos, resembling in many
points Christianity. Nix declares, in his good-natured
way, that we are more than half converted
already, and threatens to send a missionary to reason
us back from heathenism, as we need a minister
badly. He is an exceedingly good-natured fellow
is Nix, though a little broad, perhaps, at times,
in his style of jocularity. Our readers are probably
not aware that there is a certain form of vulgar
humor known as a sell, which consists in inducing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
some person to ask you a question, and then giving
some idiotic answer in reply. The other day Nix
overtook us in Broadway. After talking a few
minutes he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, I have a note for you," at the
same time feeling vigorously in his pockets.</p>

<p>"When did you get it? Who is it from?" we
inquired, with some earnestness, for we were expecting
a letter from some one.</p>

<p>"Don't know&mdash;don't know," he replied, continuing
to fumble in his pockets. "Ah, here it is."</p>

<p>At the same time grasping one hand, he placed
in it an oat&mdash;one seed of the grain upon which
horses and Scotchmen are fed.</p>

<p>Nix laughed boisterously, and told us we were
<i>sold</i>. We don't see very much fun in it.</p>

<p>We have spent another pleasant evening at the
Adams'. We mentioned in a recent chapter
making some preparations for a little party they
were about to give. Well, it went off very pleasantly
indeed; there were no hitches and no
awful pauses. Indeed, our own pleasure would
have been unalloyed had it not been for the presence
of one officious person with large whiskers,
who (there are always one or more such persons in
every assembly) obtruded his attentions too much
on the ladies; we observed that Bud, amongst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
others, was quite embarrassed by them. She was
too well bred, however, to allow him to perceive
her vexations, though I must say I think there is
is such a thing as carrying complaisance and self-abnegation
too far.</p>

<p>The scientific gentleman with gold spectacles
was there, and had an electrical novelty for us
which attracted much attention. At first we supposed
the gentleman named was giving Little
Pickle lessons in skating, for he was directing that
youth's movements as he shuffled up and down the
hearth-rug in his slippered feet. Rather jealous for
the credit of our pupil, we informed the spectacles
that there was nothing in the way of skating he
could teach Master Pickle, he being already a proficient
in that art. To which he only replied:</p>

<p>"Put your knuckle to his nose."</p>

<p>Rather staggered by this request, which savored
somewhat of the ruder style of badinage, and
the very last thing we expected from the decorous
gentleman of science, we replied, with just a shade
of hauteur:</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Put your knuckle to his nose."</p>

<p>"Really, I do not comprehend you."</p>

<p>"Put your finger to his nose and you will get a
shock."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time Little Pickle was sliding and <i>slithering</i>
up and down the rug in a manner highly
calculated to wear out that costly piece of furniture.</p>

<p>"You perceive," continued spectacles, in an explanatory
way, "that he has slippers on his feet.
By keeping his feet in close contact with the rug,
and rubbing them violently up and down, he
generates electricity in his body to such an extent
that he can transmit quite a sensible shock to
another person.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Now try!"</p>

<p>We tried. Tick! A most unmistakable spark
passed from the nose of L. P. to our knuckle.</p>

<p>The guests now began to crowd round, applying
their knuckles to the poor boy's nose to that extent
that it grew quite red, which, combined with a
trifling unsteadiness his legs acquired from the
unusual exertion, gave the dear boy quite a <i>groggy</i>
appearance. Indeed, we observed his mother
soon after draw him towards her and, stooping
down, whisper something in his ear, at which he
colored up, shook his head, and replied quickly,
"No, only lemonade."</p>

<p>The scientific person, who was really a very
amiable gentleman after all, taught us during the
evening to make quite a curious little toy&mdash;to wit,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>a miniature camera. Having enlisted the services
of Little Pickle, he procured a small pill-box, a
minute fragment about half an inch square of
broken looking-glass, and a fragment of beeswax.
He first bored a small hole in the centre of the lid
of the pill-box and another in the side; he then,
with the aid of the beeswax, stuck the piece of the
mirror across the bottom of the box at an angle of
forty-five degrees to the axis of the disc of the
box, so that by looking through one hole he could
see objects through the other hole, thus enabling
a person to look behind him. We feel that
this description is not very clear, and yet for the
life of us we do not know how to make it clearer.
The best plan for the reader will be to look well at
the diagrams showing the inside and outside of the
camera, get the wax, glass, and pill-box, and then
<i>potter</i> about with them till he gets it right.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">

</div>

<p>Camera led the conversation in our corner of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
room to the subject of optical illusions, when some
one of course suggested the hat experiment. There
is probably nothing the proportions of which are so
deceptive as a hat. Reader, if you have never
tried the experiment, take a stick and point out on
the wall how high you think a hat would reach
from the floor if placed on its crown, as represented
in our sketch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img src="images/i_249.jpg" width="560" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Aunty Delluvian, the first to try, took the stick
and boldly measured off a distance of between two
and three feet, and utterly laughed to scorn the
moderate persons who satisfied themselves with
ten inches. After each of the measurements was
marked with a pencil, and the hat itself put beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
them, showing every one to be wrong, Aunty's
amazement knew no bounds. Indeed, she would
not be satisfied till we brought our own hat to convince
her that some deception had not been practised.</p>

<p>This was Aunty Delluvian's first visit to the
Adams', having only recently been introduced
through the agency of Nix. I was, therefore, not
unprepared for some criticism on our friends; but
when the good lady, towards the close of the evening,
took us to one side and said confidentially
and emphatically, nodding her head at the same
time knowingly, "No flippery, flummery. I like
her!" we were a little surprised, the statement was
so emphatic and yet so vague. That was all she
said, walking away briskly when she had so delivered
herself, as though she had rendered a final
verdict. To which of the family did she refer?
To Mrs. Adams, we presume, and yet she might
have said something about the other members of
the family. She is a queer creature is Aunty Delluvian.</p>

<p>We are disposed to think that the <span class="smcap">ART</span> of entertaining
is rarely if ever regarded as an <span class="smcap">ART</span>, and
certainly never treated as such. We, however, on
this occasion, laid our plans and arranged our
forces with as much care and skill as a general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>exercises in laying out a campaign. We have as
profound a respect for a good commissary as ever
did Napoleon Bonaparte. We had our reserve, too,
and our signal corps, so that should the battle
waver at any moment, it might be immediately set
going again. Amongst other resources, we had a
number of surprise pictures concealed in a certain
place, which were to be produced when occasion
might require. One of these will be found on opposite
page, and comprises fifteen faces in one. Pictures
of this kind always amuse, and are fine provocatives
of conversation.</p>

</div>

<p>Reader, when you give a party, do not bring your
entire force into action at first; always have a
reserve to fall back upon.</p>

<p>We saw a whole group which was showing
alarming symptoms of demoralization rallied with
a pocket-handkerchief. Nix saw the emergency,
drew his handkerchief, tied one end round the tip
of his finger, on which, with a few dots of the pen,
he had indicated a comic face, and threw himself
into the dispirited crew, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"This is Rantepolefungus, the mysterious magician
of Morocco." Then, in a feigned voice:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="379" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"How do, pretty ladee and gentlemen? Me tell
fortune, work spell, makee incantation. Me tell you
fortune, pretty missee; you be, by-a-by, sixt wife
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>great street contractor; favorite wife, he givee

cocktails every morning. Pretty ladee, give great
magician buckshees," and a whole string of other
nonsense, the little Moor moving his head and
hands all the time, suiting the action to the words.</p>

<p>The sketches opposite will show how the Moor
is made.</p>

<p>As we walked home with Nix, smoking our
cigars, we agreed that the party had been managed
with consummate generalship. As we parted, he
asked us if we should like to have a small statue
of Vishnu? Wonder what he meant.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>Those red and green lights which lend such
a glory to the final tableaux of fairy pieces on the
public stage, can easily be introduced into private
parlor performances. There is no danger in using
them; they are quite inexpensive, and very easily
managed. Warning, however, should be given to
all asthmatic persons to vacate the ranch before
firing off, as their fumes are apt to produce unpleasant
results. When we first performed the play of
<i>Bullywingle the Beloved</i>, the red light was calculated
on as a startling feature of the performance.
At the proper moment the match was applied, the
combustibles behaved handsomely, everybody was
entranced, all save one unfortunate gentleman,
subject to asthma, who created quite a sensation by
rushing out of the house in a choking condition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and remaining speechless in the snow for over
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The mode of working these lights is to place one
of the powders, for which we shall presently give
you prescriptions, in an iron shovel, and apply
a lighted match. The powder will begin to burn
slowly, emitting a bright red or green light, accompanied
by volumes of smoke. Before exhibiting
these lights, all others in the room, gas or lamps,
should be turned down as low as possible.</p>

<p>If the operator stands behind the scenes, so as to
be out of sight during the performance, the effect is
what Artemus Ward would call <i>Trooly Grand</i>.</p>

<p>In order to procure the lights, go to some druggist
and give him the following prescriptions. He
will procure the necessary materials and mix them
for you.</p>


<h4>RED FIRE.</h4>

<p>Forty parts of dry nitrate of strontian, thirteen
parts of finely powdered sulphur, five parts of chlorate
of potash, and four parts of sulphuret of
antimony. The chlorate of potash and sulphuret
of antimony should be powdered separately in
a mortar, and then mixed together on paper; after
which they may be added to the other ingredients,
previously powdered and mixed.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<h4>GREEN FIRE.</h4>

<p>Green fire, when burned in a reflector, sheds
a beautiful light on all surrounding objects. Take
of flour of sulphur thirteen parts, of nitrate of baryta
seventy-seven, of oxymuriate of potassa five, of
metallic arsenic two, of charcoal three. The nitrate
of baryta should be well dried and powdered;
it should then be mixed with the other ingredients,
all finely pulverized, and the whole triturated until
perfectly blended together. A little calamine may
be occasionally added, in order to make the compound
slower of combustion; and it is above all
things requisite that the rubbing together of the
materials should be continued until they are completely
mixed.</p>

<p>It may so happen that in some of your parlor
theatricals you may wish to introduce a storm, so
we will tell you how to manage it.</p>

<p>There are several elements in a storm which can
be counterfeited.</p>

<p>Thunder.</p>

<p>Snow.</p>

<p>The sound of rain or hail.</p>

<p>Lightning.</p>

<p>Wind.</p>

<p>The noise of thunder is produced by shaking a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
sheet of iron behind the scenes. The sheet should
be about three feet square, and can be procured at
any stove store.</p>

<p>Snow can be represented by throwing handfuls
of small scraps of paper from above.</p>

<p>It is best to mount on a chair or step-ladder
behind the scenes, and strew them down in the
proper direction. The scraps of paper should be of
course white and <i>torn</i>, not cut, of the requisite
size.</p>

<p>The sound of rain or hail is produced thus: Get
the carpenter to make for you a box, from eight to
twelve feet in length, and of about four inches inside
diameter; put in a couple of handfuls of dried
peas, and then fasten up the box; when you wish to
make rain, tilt up one end of the box and let the
peas run down to the other end, then reverse the
box and let them run back again. As long as you
continue to do this you will have an excellent imitation
of rain, at least as far as the sound is concerned.</p>

<p>Lightning is imitated by having a lamp in a box;
whenever you want to produce a flash, open the lid
suddenly and close it again. Of course all the other
lights in the room must have been previously
lowered.</p>

<p>Wind. Sufficient wind to blow about the flakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of snow can be produced with a very large fan, a
wooden frame with calico stretched over it being as
good as anything. But to simulate the effects of a
gale, some other means must be adopted.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="496" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>We will assume that the curtain rises on a storm
scene; thunder and hail are heard, and fitful flashes
of lightning illumine the landscape. Enter a wandering
female, a little girl, we will presume, in search
of shelter; as she walks on to the stage leaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
forward as though struggling against the blast, her
shawl and dress are violently agitated by the wind.
To produce this effect attach two or three strong
threads to the garments named, and at the proper
time jerk and pull them with a tremulous motion, to
impart the natural action. The preceding diagram
will illustrate our meaning.</p>

<p>These instructions may be found useful to
amateur players, and will certainly heighten the
effect of the performance when they can be introduced.</p>

<p>There is another point in connection with <i>make-up</i>
to which we may as well call the reader's attention
before closing this chapter. All persons, no
matter how ruddy their complexions may be, look
pale or sallow under the influence of the bright
light necessary to illuminate a stage; to counteract
this effect it is absolutely necessary to rouge, or in
other words, paint the cheeks pink; a little carmine
from your paint-box will serve for this purpose, if
you have not the regular rouge powder on hand.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>It is marvellous how much amusement, in a
quiet way, can be got out of a pair of scissors
and a piece of card-board. Moreover, if the fingers
be plump and white, we know of no position in
which they look more tantalizingly bewitching,
than when harnessed like a couple of white mice
in the iron yoke of a pair of liliputian shears. We
have passed many a pleasant evening in contemplating
and cutting. On one occasion which we
remember well, as it led to sudden and unexpected
matrimony of a valued friend, we sat till twelve
o'clock at night and used up a whole pack of cards,
except the jack of diamonds, in making boomerangs
and other mechanical notions. The boomerang we
have already introduced to our readers, and some of
the other contraptions we shall now proceed to explain.
So scare up all the cards you can, and bring
out your army of scissors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="287" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One card puzzle we have often tried, and with
which most persons are familiar, is that of the
cross. You cut out of card or stiff paper, five
pieces similar in shape and size to the following, viz.
one piece of fig. 1, one piece of fig. 2, and three
pieces of fig. 3.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>These five pieces you put together so as to make
a cross like Figure 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i_264a.jpg" width="336" height="405" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>If you cannot solve the problem, look at the
following cut, and you will cease to be puzzled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i_264b.jpg" width="336" height="415" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now we will try another card puzzle. Cut a
piece of card or paper in the shape of a horse-shoe,
and mark on it the places for the nails as represented
in the subjoined sketch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The puzzle is with two cuts to divide it into six
parts, each part containing one nail.</p>

<p>Of course you cannot do it; we could not do
it ourselves, and had to get the white mice to show
us the way.</p>

<p>Somehow or another we never can find out anything
with half a dozen taper fingers fluttering
before our eyes. They bewilder us terribly, getting
between the feet of our ideas, so to speak, and tripping
us up; as young lambs might serve an
awkward shepherd.</p>

<p>Well, the mystery is solved thus: you cut off the
upper circular part, containing two of the nails;
then by changing the position of the piece, another
cut will divide the horse-shoe into six portions, each
containing one nail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_265.jpg" width="430" height="336" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The next trick is of a slightly different style.
Cut two pieces of card like those represented in the
diagram and place them in the position represented;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the problem is, with a small stick or lead-pencil, to
raise them from the table, without of course touching
them with your fingers. You may try this as
often as you like. If you succeed, well and good; if
you do not, you can come back here and refer to the
solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="424" height="336" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Here is a picture (No. 2) representing the way
in which it is done; need we add anything in the
way of explanation? We think not&mdash;so we won't
do it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>Nix has a sister married to a wealthy leather
merchant, whose place of business is in that odoriferous
part of New York city called The Swamp.
She is very beautiful, so we call her the <i>Swamp
Angel</i>, and her husband's counting-house, <i>Araby the
Blest</i>. Her children we have christened <i>Findings</i>,
the youngest being always spoken of as the <i>last</i>.
We have numerous jokes, of course, about the <i>cobbler
sticking to his last</i>, the <i>best quality of calf</i>, and
so on. She is very good-natured, and enjoys our
badinage heartily, having a healthy vein of fun of
her own, which transmutes all the little events of
domestic life into the most refined humor. We
like humor in a woman, or we should rather say in a
gentlewoman; her culture and the natural tact peculiar
to her sex, seem to eliminate any of those
grosser particles which the coarse sensibilities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a man would not detect. Humor is as fascinating
in a woman as sarcasm is abominable; it requires
the very highest breeding to make the latter quality
moderately safe in the hands of young women. For
our own part, we would rather see a woman chew
tobacco than hear her say sharp things. However,
this is a digression. Mrs. Crofton, as we said, is
very fond of fun, and in her house there is that
perfect ease and abandon which can only be enjoyed
by well-bred people; whoever visits there is
at home; and a favored few, of whom the writer has
the honor of being one, are treated quite as <i>enfants
de famille</i>.</p>

<p>If, on calling, we find the heads of the house
from home, we know where the claret and cigars
are kept. Cicero, the negro waiter, obeying standing
orders, promptly serves up some repast, and
presses the hospitality of the house upon us with
all the aplomb and grace for which his race are
remarkable.</p>

<p>We drop into breakfast whenever we feel so disposed,
and invite ourselves to dinner or tea as
freely as though our friends kept a hotel; indeed
we jocularly call their mansion by various public
names: "The Crofton House," "Fifth Avenue
Hotel," "The Shoe and Leather House," etc., etc.
We have perpetrated more sheer, downright non<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>sense
in their saloons than any forty strait-laced
country school-children ever condescended to commit
in their rural play-ground.</p>

<p>One day during the holidays, when some fourteen
or fifteen friends had dropped in <i>quite promiscuous</i>,
and were playing all kinds of tricks, a certain
gentleman, imported from England, an officer in the
Guards, genus Swell, "pwoposed" that we should
play the <i>Muffin man</i>. As none of us had ever
heard of this gentleman or the muffin business,
there was a general cry for light.</p>

<p>"Oh, its vewy jolly, I asshua yaw. We all sit
wound in a wing, yaw know, and one of us, yaw
know, sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Do yaw know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do yaw know his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do yaw know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lives in Cwumpet Lane.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Then the next person answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, yes, I know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes, I know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes, I know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lives in Cwumpet<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Lane.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Then he turns to the next person, and when each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
person has sung his verse, yaw know, he then joins
in the cawus,<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
until it has gone all wound;<a name="FNanchor_B_5" id="FNanchor_B_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_5" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> then,
yaw know, we all sing together:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'We all know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all know his name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We all know the muffin man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lives in Cwumpet Lane.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">The game is, yaw know, to keep a gwave<a name="FNanchor_C_6" id="FNanchor_C_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_6" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> face all
the time. If yaw laugh yaw pay a forfeit."</p>

<p>"The muffin man, the muffin man," echoed half
a dozen voices; "let us play the muffin man."</p>

<p>The proposition being carried <i>nem. con.</i>, we all
sat "wound in a wing," or round in a ring, a circle
of individuals of every age from three up to seventy.
The Englishman, as head instigator, started the
game, but before he got half through his verse we
were all in convulsions of laughter; the next person
took it up, but it was utterly useless to think
of collecting the forfeits; we were all, in spite of
every effort, like a party of maniacs reeling in our
seats with merriment. There was something so
utterly idiotic and absurd in a large party of respectable,
rational beings, congratulating themselves
in song that they "knew the muffin man of
Crumpet Lane."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>The English swell was immediately made an
honorary member of our order, which is, as yet,
without a name.</p>

<p>As we had all laughed our throats dry, Mr. Crofton
invited us into the next room to <i>see a man</i>, as
the Immortal Artemus delicately expresses it, so
we all went in and saw the man. Some of us saw
him in ice claret, some in hot punch, and some in
cool champagne. One of Crofton's children, a
maiden aged three years, whom they called Toney,
as the diminutive of her Christian name, Antonia,
came toddling in with the rest and said:</p>

<p>"Me, Nooni, want see man." Whereupon her
father gave her a goblet of lemonade. She just
tasted it, and handed it back with supreme contempt,
saying:</p>

<p>"Me, Nooni, want banny wasser;" which being
translated into English means:</p>

<p>"Me, Toney, wants brandy and water."</p>

<p>The little voluptuary was satisfied with a glass of
weak claret punch.</p>

<p>During this conversation, Bub, a patriarch of
five years, who had been looking on with a very
patronizing air, now came forward, and laying his
hand on his sister's shoulder, lisped out:</p>

<p>"Oh, you tunnen witty sing, zats nice banny
water." Then turning to us in a confidential way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
he continued: "She's a witty durl (little girl); she
finks (thinks) zats banny water; banny water make
witty durls fick (sick); me, big boy, banny water
not make me fick."</p>

<p>We gave him a nondescript drink, flavored with
every liquor on the table, which made him feel immensely
proud.</p>

<p>"Let us play at earth, air, fire, and water," said
Mrs. Crofton.</p>

<p>"Very well, Toney," answered her husband.
"You can play at earth, and I will play with the
fire-water." So saying, he filled himself a glass of
punch, and stretched his limbs in an easy-chair.</p>

<p>"I think my husband is the laziest fellow living,"
laughed Mrs. Crofton. "I do believe if I were
being carried off by wild Indians, he would make a
note of it in his memorandum book, to have his
porter attend to the matter next day."</p>

<p>Nix here interposed: "Dear, dear, these family
quarrels are very painful. Come, Toney, and help
to amuse the young people. Earth, air, fire, and
water, whatever that may be, is the order of the
day. How do you play it, Toney?"</p>

<p>"You all sit round the room, and then one of the
party throws something at one of the others, at the
same time naming one of the elements, earth, or
air, or fire, or water; then he begins to count one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and before
he says ten, the person struck must name some
animal living in the element chosen."</p>

<p>"Well, but what do you throw at the person?"
inquired Nix; "a bureau, or decanter, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No, no; something small and soft, like a pair
of gloves, or&mdash;or&mdash;oh, I know, wait a minute and I
will run up-stairs and get the baby's worsted ball;
that will be just the thing."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Crofton was absent, and she was
detained rather longer than her mission seemed to
warrant, Nix, in poking about in his sister's work-basket
in pursuit of mischief, discovered a piece of
white beeswax.</p>

<p>"Eureka!" he exclaimed, "I have it; we will
play Toney a trick before she comes back; we will
make her think some one has broken her new mirror."</p>

<p>Saying this, he advanced to a large pier-glass between
the windows, and marked on it a huge star
with the white wax something like the accompanying
diagram, and then instructed one or two of us
to make lamentations over it when his sister should
return. We had not to wait long: in a few minutes
Mrs. C. entered the room, whereupon we conspirators
set to work gesticulating, and talking over the
supposed catastrophe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear! dear!" said one, "how unfortunate!"</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" queried a second.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_274.jpg" width="480" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I really don't know," answered a third. "I
merely heard a crash, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the lady came on the scene, looking quite
flushed.</p>

<p>"I knew you children would be in some mischief,"
she said, "while I was away. I suppose this
is some of my clumsy brother's work. He never
comes into the house without destroying something."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," whined Nix, contritely; "it
was quite an accident, I assure you; but I wonder
whether it could not be mended?"</p>

<p>"Mended! you goose," exclaimed his sister.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
"Who ever heard of mending a broken mirror! It
will take a pretty big cheque on your banker to
mend that, sir."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," replied Nix. "If it is
not very bad I might&mdash;&mdash;any way I will try."
Suiting the action to the words, he advanced towards
the mirror in such a position that his sister
could not see what he did, and very deliberately
wiped out the wax marks with his pocket-handkerchief.
The astonishment of Mrs. C. at this miracle
knew no bounds, nor could the gift of any amount
of new pier-glasses have given her more pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now, then, all take your seats; we are going to
play earth, air, fire, and water."</p>

<p>The circle is formed; our hostess holds the woollen
ball poised in her hand for an instant, and then
sends it flying into the bosom of a grey-haired old
gentleman, at the same time uttering the word "air,"
and commencing to count rapidly, "one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." The old
gentleman seemed utterly paralysed until she had
finished counting, when he stammered out, "Wh&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pig</span>!"
amidst the roars of laughter
of every one present. Of course he had to pay a
forfeit, and took his turn at throwing the ball.</p>

<p>No one who has not seen this game played
can conceive how ludicrous it is, or how much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
good wholesome laughter may be got out of it.
When a sufficient number of forfeits had accumulated,
they were cried in the usual manner. A
good deal of ingenuity was displayed in awarding
the tasks as well as in executing them. One was
that the owner of this "pretty thing" should make
an impromptu containing the names of every one
in the room, and was managed in the following
style:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Three Howards&mdash;Corsey, Toney, Archibald, and Nix,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bub, Brown, Campbell, Jim and Jane have got me in a fix."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noidt">Another task imposed was, that the owner of a
cigar-case should give us a riddle no one could
solve. Going into the next room, this person procured
a glass of wine, and holding it up said: "Gentlemen,
I give you 'the ladies.'" No one attempted
to solve this riddle. Another gentleman was ordered
to point out the greatest goose in the room.
This delicate task he set about performing in the
following manner: he went to one young lady and
asked her to hold up her face to the light, which
she did, whereupon he imprinted a chaste salute on
her lips; he then went to the next, but she persisted
in holding down her head. He then turned
round to his tasker and said: "Really it is impossible
for me to determine which are the geese if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
will not allow me to examine their bills." He was
let off.</p>

<p>When all the forfeits were restored, even to little
Toney's pocket-handkerchief, which she recovered
by throwing herself into her papa's arms and hugging
him round the neck, as the <i>prettiest</i>, and <i>wittiest</i>,
and <i>one she loved best</i>, we all adjourned to broiled
oysters and chicken salad.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>A few days ago when the blistering sun had
converted the whole of New York city into one
vast bake-oven, Nix called at our office, and proposed
a flying trip to a certain watering-place. We
will not mention its name for fear of incurring the
suspicion of writing puffs. It was, however, sufficiently
unfashionable to be tolerably comfortable.
In order to reach our destination we took an early
steamboat, leaving New York at six o'clock in the
morning. With what intense satisfaction we became
conscious of possessing lungs as we inhaled
the cool air which had been washing itself all night
in the great waves of the Atlantic ocean, or sleeping
among the pine-woods of Delaware and New
Jersey. There is nothing surely which makes one
feel more grateful for the gift of life than to breathe
the early morning air, laden with the perfume of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
salt-water. On this occasion the bracing atmosphere
gave a relish to everything. The crisp broiled ham,
the clam-fritters, and even the miserable coffee we
had for breakfast on board, all tasted like food
worthy of the gods. And as for our cigars (genuine
Havanas) which followed the meal, their incense
fairly sent us up to the seventh heaven of delight.
But our business is to write on the <i>Art of Amusing</i>,
and although an early steamboat trip may be one
of the most enjoyable of things, it scarcely comes
within the sphere of our work.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the hotel, we found the lady
guests were in process of organizing a fair for the
benefit of the sufferers by the great Portland fire.</p>

<p>Nix rushed into the enterprise with his usual
enthusiasm; and by that evening, when the fair
commenced, had fully qualified himself to start in
business as a Three-sticks-a-penny-man. This
plebeian pastime he had picked up at some English
race or fair he had once visited, and now attempted
with considerable success to acclimatize in America.
His first step was to go to the village store
and purchase a number of penknives, jack-knives,
pincushions, tobacco-boxes, and similar contraptions.
His second care was to cut half-a-dozen
hickory-sticks or wands, of about four feet six
inches in length, and of the thickness of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
middle finger&mdash;that is, if you are blest with as
spacious a paw as ourself; if not, we feel at a loss
how to convey to your mind an approximate idea
of the measurement. But suppose you take any
healthy Irish day-laborer, and make his third finger
the standard, not the part where the knobs are,
but the spaces between them. Well, Nix cut six
sticks of about the thickness of a healthy Irish
day-laborer's third finger, in the spaces between the
joints or knobs. He then cut a dozen other sticks
of about the thickness of anybody's wrist, and about
two feet long. Good! When he wished to commence
operations on the fair-ground he selected a
piece of level turf, and on one side of it dug six
holes about the size of the late Daniel Webster's
hat; these holes he half filled with sand, and in the
centre of every hole he then stuck one of the sticks
of <i>about</i> the thickness of a healthy Irish, etc., etc.
Then on the top of each stick he balanced a jack-knife,
pin-cushion, or some other object of more or
less value. Now all his preparations were completed.
He was prepared to receive customers. Standing
in a commanding attitude, at a distance of
about thirty feet from the arrangement we have
described, he cried out in truly English style:</p>

<p>"Now, ladies and gents, ere yer are&mdash;three
sticks a penny. Any lady or gent wishin to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
a immediate fortin, and marry the being of his art
on the result, have only to invest a few dollars in
my establishment, and he will retire wealthy in arf
a nour. Here, ladies and gents, look at these ere
sticks" (holding up one of the clubs about the thickness
of anybody's wrist), "hall you ave to do is to
throw one of these ere at them there" (pointing to
the pincushions, etc.); "hany article you knock orf
is yourn, provided it don't fall inter the ole. Now,
all I charge you for the priviledge orf throwin'
three of these sticks, is the radicerlously small sum
of ten cents. You are sure to win five dollars
each time. Now, walk up; walk up, and take yer
chance, and make yer everlastin fortin; marry the
hobject of yer haffections, and build yer pallatial
willa on the Udson."</p>

<p>Here a courageous youth stepped up, examined
the whole arrangement minutely, and concluded to
invest ten cents. Fortunately for Nix and the
cause this youth knocked off a dollar jack-knife at
the first throw. The consequence was an immense
rush of patronage; indeed, the sport became so
exciting that two similar establishments could have
been kept in active operation. As it was, Nix
cleared fifty-four dollars over and above all expenses
for the good of the fair, and the benefit of the poor
folks of Portland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Nix's most profitable customers was a
good-natured flashy young man of the wholesale
dry-goods pattern, who appeared each day in some
new shade of mustard-colored clothing, from the
delicate yellow of freshly mixed pure Durham to
the rich tones of stale German. He told us in confidence
that he had intended to go to Saratoga, but the
<i>old gentleman</i> and <i>old lady</i> (his father and mother)
had insisted on his coming down with them to
"this d&mdash;&mdash;d hole;" then, suddenly recollecting
that we had all probably come from chance, he
added:</p>

<p>"Oh, this is a very nice place; first-rate; I don't
say anything about that, only I had a party of
friends going up to Saratoga, and they'll expect me;
they know there's always fun going on where I am.
It don't make any difference to me whether I spend
fifty dollars or five hundred. I'm bound to have a
good time. I appreciate anything; tha's&mdash;anything,
you know&mdash;tha's got any wit into it, you
know. Well, you know, there are some people who
ain't got any idea; don't seem to appreciate, you
know. Now, when I saw you throwin' sticks, well,
I piled right in; I didn't care about it, of course,
only I saw what you were doing it for, and I didn't
care. Some people would think it awful vulgar,
you know, but I don't care; that's the sort of man I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
am. Perhaps I shouldn't have liked some of my
aristocratic lady friends to have seen me; but then
down here, you know. Oh, I'd just as lief have
given the money to the fair; I'd spent thirty dollars
before in slippers and things, and then gave 'em
back. I didn't want 'em, you know, only I like to
see things lively; there's bound to be fun when
I'm round."</p>

<p>However, we will not follow our good-natured
friend through his long monologue of refined
egotism; we merely introduced him because he
showed us a variety of tricks, two of which we
think worth recording in our book on amusements.
On the morning after the fair, Nix and ourself, in
company with the mustard-colored aristocrat, took
a bath in the ocean. The aristocrat appeared in
the water attired in a sumptuous bathing dress,
smoking a cigar which he told us cost $800 per
thousand; which, he frankly confessed, he thought
too high a price for a man to pay for cigars
in these times. He further stated that he relished
smoking in the water very much. To our inquiry
whether there was no danger of the waves putting
it out, he replied by informing us that he could dive
under water with a lighted cigar in his mouth without
extinguishing it.</p>

<p>"D'you see that boat there?" he said, pointing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
a small scow about a hundred and fifty yards distant.
"Well, I will dive under that; you watch
me, and you will see me come up." We thought
there must be some hoax in the matter, and so kept
a strict eye upon his movements. He swam out to
the craft, gave a plunge and a kick, after the manner
of ducks in a pond, disappeared, and came up
on the other side, calmly puffing his weed. Never
having seen or heard of the feat before, Nix and
ourself were what the ancient Greeks used to call
<i>flabbergasterd</i>. When he had enjoyed his triumph
and our bewilderment for a few minutes, he showed
us how it was done; simply by putting the lighted
end of the cigar in his mouth just before going
under water, that was all. He added: "I will
show you something better if you will come up to
the shooting-gallery after we get through bathing.
Did you ever see a man ring the bell with his back
to the target?"</p>

<p>Arrived at the shooting-gallery, our young friend
procured a mirror which he hung on the wall opposite
the target, then placing himself in front of the
former, with his back to the latter, he held the
pistol over his shoulder and took aim, looking at
the image of the pistol in the glass as if it were the
pistol itself; that is, in such a manner that the
reflection of the object was covered by the reflec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>tion
of the pistol; he then fired, and came within
an inch of the bull's-eye.</p>

<p>When we got back to the hotel he amused us by
setting fire to a glass of alcohol with a burning
glass. He placed a silver dollar (a red cent would
have answered as well) in the spirit, and then directed
the rays of the sun through the burning-glass
on the metal; in an instant the liquid was all ablaze.</p>

<p>In the afternoon this same youth called us all to
enjoy a trick he had played upon the <i>old gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>old gentleman</i>, it appeared, was engaged in
reading Macaulay's History of England, and like a
methodical old gentleman, whenever he laid down
the book, marked the place where he left off. On
the day in question his son had abstracted his book
from its accustomed place, and painted on the page
following the one he was, reading a very excellent
imitation of a fly. At his usual hour the old
gentleman was seen to put on his spectacles,
and take up the book; all those in the secret were
of course on hand; presently he came to the passage
on which appeared the counterfeit fly; the old gentleman
shook the book, but the fly stirred not;
then he blew at it; then he laid down the volume,
and deliberately taking out his handkerchief, made
a pass at the offending insect with that weapon,
replaced his handkerchief, settled his glasses, took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
up the book again, but to his utter surprise the fly
still remained. A light seemed now to dawn on
him&mdash;the fly had got crushed between the leaves&mdash;so
he essayed to remove it with his finger-nail;
here his hopeful offspring could stand it no longer,
and burst into a roar of laughter, in which several
others joined. When the joke was explained to the
worthy victim, he said: "Now, that's very good,
isn't it; very good. I made sure it was a real fly,
as true as you live. Look here, wife; look at this,
some of Master Tom's doing; good, ain't it; as true
as you live, that's a fact. Ah! Ha!"<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Later in the evening Young Hopeful horrified a
circle of ladies by discovering at their feet a huge
spider; in the midst of their shrieks and exclamations
a courageous gentleman with large whiskers
stepped forward to crush the intruder, raised his foot,
and brought it down firmly, but staggered back
astounded&mdash;the creature had exploded with a loud
report, conveying an idea of vindictiveness and
power truly appalling. The young gentleman
took us aside and explained the mystery, at the
same time producing from his pocket a small box
containing some half-dozen similar spiders.</p>

<p>"I have them made on purpose for me," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
"A German porter in our store first put me up to
it, and I told him to set to work and make me as
many as he liked, and charge me any price he
chose. I tell ye, that Dutchman thinks I'm a great
boy. I pay him about five dollars a week for
spiders; well, you know, that's a good deal for a
man like him; only gets twelve dollars a week in
the store."</p>

<p>We examined the specimen carefully, and found
it was constructed very much on the plan of the torpedoes
used by children on the Fourth of July; only
the paper was brown and a little thicker, and there
were legs of fine wire attached, which gave it a very
lifelike and spidery appearance. The Dutchman
had evidently gone into the matter <i>con amore</i>, for
he had taken the pains to wash some of his specimens
with gum, and then sprinkle them with wool-dust
to produce the appearance of what are called
hairy spiders. About one-third of a grain of fulminating
silver produces the explosion in each.
They are very easily made.</p>

<p>As we steamed back to the great city of New
York next day, Nix said he thought we had made a
very good investment of three red-hot days of mid-summer
time. We thought so, too.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_7" id="Footnote_A_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_7"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> We have since seen a somewhat similar trick played by painting a fly on the
face of a watch or inside the glass.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>We are not a great advocate for arithmetical
puzzles as a pastime for festive occasions, that is to
say not as a general rule; but there are certain tricks
of figures which are quite amusing, and some few
problems which from their very simplicity become
almost ludicrous. We have seen many a tolerably
wise head puzzled over the question:</p>

<p>"If a barrel of flour cost thirty-nine dollars thirteen
and three quarter cents, what will a penny loaf
come to?"</p>

<p>And consume considerable time and paper without
discovering the obvious fact, that a penny loaf
will of course come to a penny and nothing else.</p>

<p>We remember, too, an amiable Divine, who
tortured his dear old head for three-quarters of an
hour to solve the question:</p>

<p>"If a shovel, poker, and tongs, cost thirteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
dollars forty-three and a quarter cents, what will a
ton of coals come to?"</p>

<p>And when informed that they would come to
ashes, he seemed to feel quite hurt; and indeed, to
labor for some time under a sense of having been
trifled with. When told that it was merely a joke,
a little fun, he replied that he was a great admirer
of Don Quixote, could appreciate Gil Bias, and
relished exceedingly the wit of Swift and Sterne;
but failed to perceive the particular humor of our
joke about the ton of coals.</p>

<p>With all due respect for the estimable prelate, we
must venture to differ from him, fortified as we are
in our opinion by a young lady, who, if not a
divine herself, has a pair of eyes that are, in
whose company we have solved some of the most
intricate arithmetical jocularities and trivialities, till
we were up to the eyes in ink and love. One we
well remember, partly because it gave us so much
trouble, and partly because there was a wild picturesqueness
about the subject which appeals to our
imagination. It ran thus:</p>

<p>A man has a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage, to carry
over a river, but he can only convey them one at a
time, his boat being very small. How is he to
manage this, so that the wolf may not be left alone
with the goat, nor the goat with the cabbage? It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is obvious if the wolf be left with the goat, he will
eat it up; whilst if the goat be left with the cabbage,
short work will be made of that classic vegetable.</p>

<p>Oh, how often we crossed and recrossed that
river; how often we took the goat out, and put the
wolf in; and how frequently we took out the wolf,
and put in the goat. How we trembled for the
poor man, fearing there could be no alternative for
him but to sacrifice either the goat or the cabbage,
or else kill the wolf. How varied and wild were
our expedients, such as throwing the wolf across,
sending the cabbage round by express, digging
a tunnel under the bed of the river, forcing the
proprietor to eat the cabbage himself, towing the
goat behind the boat, and other devices too numerous
to mention, all of which we were assured,
by those holding the key to the mystery, were
altogether inadmissible; and then when, with humbled
pride, we reluctantly <i>gave it up</i>, how mad we were
at the simplicity of the solution, which was this:</p>

<p>He first takes over the goat, and then returns for
the wolf; he then takes back the goat, which he
leaves, and takes over the cabbage, he then returns
and takes over the goat All as simple as A, B, C,
when <i>you know how to do it</i>; that knowing how to
do it is the great difficulty in ninety-nine out of
every hundred things in this world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>Puzzles which involve long and laborious calculation
are not in our line; they are too suggestive of
the school and the country room. Something like
the following is good for skirmishing:</p>


<p class="center">PROBLEM.</p>

<p>Put down four nines, so that they will make one
hundred.</p>

<p>After a short struggle you surrender at discretion,
and in an instant get the</p>


<p class="center">SOLUTION.</p>

<p class="center">99<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>9</sub></small></p>

<p>There is no delay, no tedious figuring up; you get
your answer and are ready for something fresh.
Some such abstruse calculation as the following, for
instance:</p>


<p class="center">PROBLEM.</p>

<p>If a herring and a half cost three cents, how
many will you get for a dollar?</p>

<p>To ladies, who as a general rule have not the
organ of calculation very largely developed, this will
usually prove a poser. As the problem is to be
solved by patience and study, we will leave them to
do it, <i>or give it up</i>, and proceed to the next</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PROBLEM.</p>

<p>A gentleman sent his servant with a present of
nine ducks in a box, upon which was the following
direction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Alderman Gobble with IX. ducks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The servant, who had more ingenuity than honesty,
purloined three of the ducks, and contrived it
so that the number contained in the box corresponded
with that upon the direction. As he
neither erased any word or letter, nor substituted
a new direction, how did he so alter it as to correspond
with the contents of the box?</p>

<p>The dishonest but ingenious servant simply placed
the letter S before the two Roman numerals, IX.
The direction then read thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Alderman Gobble, with SIX ducks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be seen that this problem is very easy
of solution to every one, save Artemus Ward, who
would spell it <i>Sicks dux in a bocks</i>.</p>

<p>Here is one, however, which would suit the taste,
if not the ability, of the great showman to a nicety:</p>


<p class="center">PROBLEM.</p>

<p>To distribute among three persons twenty-one
casks of wine, seven of them full, seven of them
empty, and seven of them half full; so that each of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>

<p>We have observed that Tableaux and Charades
run in some families, and that these families are
always ready to spend any amount of time and
money to carry out their favorite ideas; we cannot
help feeling considerable admiration for any one
having some honest enthusiasm for any amusement
in this toiling age of ours. But our mission is not to
deal much with the costly or complicated. Those
who wish to produce tableaux from Waverley or the
Bride of Abydos, who desire to attire themselves as
Mary Queen of Scots, Di Vernon, or Dolly Varden,
we leave to their own devices, giving only our best
wishes. There are, however, charades to be got
up on the spur of the moment, which are not
less entertaining than the more elaborate performances
to which we allude. We will mention one or
two which have come under our observation during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a chequered existence; they may serve to give the
key-note, if nothing more.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a certain impromptu party,
the lady of the house begged some of her guests to
get up <i>something</i> which would entertain the rest,
some charades, or what not. Two gentlemen
consulted for a moment, and then took up their
positions in the back of the parlor, which represented
the stage. One sat down to read, whilst the
other crept up slyly behind him, and much to his
dismay turned off the gas. They then both rose
and declared the charade completed, leaving it to
the audience to divine the answer. Whether any
one guessed it or not we do not know&mdash;but the
answer was Gastric&mdash;Gas-trick.</p>

<p>Another gentleman then stepped into the stage,
with a large hat at the back of his head, and began
calling&mdash;"Mooley, mooley, mooley; com, com,
mooley. Where kin that keow a poked herself now?
she's allers a concealing of herself somewheres or
another&mdash;mooley," etc.,</p>

<p>His riddle was now concluded, and he desired the
audience to give him the answer.</p>

<p>The answer was <i>Cow-hiding</i>.</p>

<p>A famous physician and wit was the next to
come forward, accompanied by a friend. They
took positions in opposite corners of the room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
advanced towards each other, and as they passed,
the friend said to the doctor, "How do, Doctor?"
To the surprise of all, they declared the charade
completed. No one could guess it, of course; the
answer was <i>metaphysician</i>, met-a-physician.</p>

<p>Again they took their positions precisely as
before, announcing that they were about to give
another charade. Again they walked across the
room, and as they passed, one said to the other,
"How do, again?" This was the conclusion of the
second charade; quite as puzzling as the first, only
more so. The answer was <i>metaphor</i>&mdash;met-afore.
This absurdity was received with roars of laughter
and thunders of applause.</p>

<p>Charades of this kind, we are inclined to think,
give more real pleasure after all, than the studied,
costly elaborations. They are perhaps not so pretty;
but, ye gods! where there are pretty women,
what else could mortal man desire in the way
of beauty!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p>A certain young lady with whom we are
acquainted has discovered a new art, which seems
to absorb a great portion of her being. It is
a method by which almost anything may be transmuted
into coral. The consequence of this discovery
is that the English-basement house in which
the maid in question dwells, is converted into
a perfect mermaid's grotto. We told her so the
other day, since which she has called us her Triton;
and further intimated that in order to preserve the
fitness of things, we might invite her to an oyster
supper at Delmonico's. This hint we took with the
avidity of a pickerel; but alas for the fickleness of
woman, and our visions of marine happiness, the
damsel changed her position and absolutely declined
accepting our hospitality, even to the extent of a
shrimp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>It is marvellous what very poor jokes afford rich
amusement, when they are passed amongst intimate
friends. When we called the lady in question,
South Coral-ina, every one present seemed quite
amused; indeed only one person, an obnoxious
individual with large whiskers, seemed to resent it
at all:&mdash;but now that the title by frequent repetition
has assumed the character of a nickname, it is
always received as an exquisite piece of humor.
Numerous ramifications of this subject afford us
endless themes for badinage.</p>

<p>We profess to ridicule the idea that involuntary
servitude is abolished, when South Coral-ina holds
ourselves and so many others in slavery. She retorts
by calling us Neptune, and asking after the telegraph
cable. When this badinage had been going on for
some time, our friend Nix played quite a pretty
hoax on the ladies. He arrived one evening with a
somewhat dirty-looking basket on his arm filled with
oysters. This was rather an inelegant thing to
bring into the parlor, and naturally excited some
surprise; but when he began to take out the
grimy-looking bivalves, and one by one, hand
them round to the ladies, there was a commotion
bordering on indignation; the first lady
declined to receive so plebeian a gift, whereupon
Nix took a penknife from his pocket and opened it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
revealing the inside lined with rich velvet, and
bearing some trinket made of gold and pearls.
This was in payment of a bet of an oyster supper
which he had playfully made with and purposely
lost to one of the ladies.</p>

<p>But to revert to our Coral. We often aided the
fair mermaid in her manufactures, making sprays of
coral nearly as large as in currant bushes, coral
walking-canes, coral ear-rings, pen racks, paper
weights, and other useful articles. We converted
into coral&mdash;walnuts, small mud-turtles, birds' claws,
sea-shells, and indeed almost everything on which
we could lay our hands. Finally we took paterfamilias'
felt hat one night and gave it a couple of coats
of scarlet varnish, much to the astonishment of that
good gentleman when he wished to put it on next
morning.</p>

<p>The mode of making these coral ornaments is, of
course, very simple; otherwise it would not find
a place in this book:</p>


<h4>RECEIPT.</h4>

<p>To two drachms of fine vermilion, add one ounce
of clear resin, and melt them together; paint the
object with this mixture while hot, and then hold it
over a gentle fire till it is perfectly covered and
smooth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>To make sprays of coral you should procure some
twigs of thorn; peel and dry, before painting with
the varnish.</p>

<p>The Nix gift of pearls has set all the ladies
to work on a new idea&mdash;painting pictures in oil-colors
on the inside of oyster shells; these are
mostly marine subjects where the natural hues of
the shell supply the requisite tints for the
clouds and water. One of these little works represented
a fish, where the sheen of the mother-of-pearl
gave a marvellously natural effect to the
scales and gills.</p>

<p>They have also taken to making pictures on egg-shells
in water-colors, which are very pretty. One
egg they tattooed all over with pen-and-ink arabesque,
and emblazoned with crimson and gold. It
looks very handsome, though possibly of not quite
so much practical use as a locomotive or a reaping-machine.
Still, let us always remember that quotation
from Goethe:</p>

<p>"<i>Encourage the beautiful, the useful will take care
of itself!</i>"</p>

<p>To which we might add a paraphrase of our
own:</p>

<p>"Encourage the amusing, the dreary will take
care of itself."</p>

<p>For our own part we have serious ideas of organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>izing
a SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT
OF AMUSEMENT. We firmly believe
that judicious and rational amusement tends more
to make men <i>healthy</i>, <i>wealthy</i>, <i>and wise</i>, than ever
did early rising, for which, nevertheless, we have
profoundest respect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p>To those who are fond of charades, and indeed to
all those good people who love to be merry, we
commend what the French call <i>charades en action</i>,
or pantomime charades. These charades, as the
name indicates, are acted, not spoken. The great
rule to be observed is silence, nothing more than
an exclamation being allowed. In extreme cases,
where it is utterly impossible to convey the idea by
actions, a placard may be introduced bearing some
helpful inscription, as in the case of Mr. Cuffy (in
the charade on carpet which we shall presently
give), who draws from his bosom a monster letter
from Mr. Swab, which he displays to the audience.
In addition to the information it conveys, the production
of this preposterously large note is calculated
to create a laugh.</p>

<p>The chief merit in a charade actor is inventive ingenuity
in so, adapting the domestic adjuncts of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
ordinary household as to supply the place of necessary
theatrical properties and wardrobe. We have
seen a very respectable Richard C&#339;ur de Lion made
up of the tinware of an ordinary cooking-range; and
Queen Elizabeth, frill, hair and all, out of a few
copies of the <i>Daily Tribune</i>. We have known a
steam fire-engine to be manufactured out of a
baby's crib and a tea-kettle; and Bunker Hill monument
from two chairs, a fishing-rod, and a sheet.
Those who have followed us so far through these
pages, have gone through a good course of study,
and will start with great advantages in the pursuit
of charade-acting.</p>

<p>For the convenience of our clients we add a list
of words which may be acted as charades.</p>

<span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Sixth Avenue, New York.</i></p>

<p>Scene opens and discovers street-car driving
furiously along, drawn by two chestnut acquaintances.
Conductor and driver represented by two
small boys. Car composed of lounge, clothes-horse,
and two chairs, judiciously arranged and
draped; wheels of band box-lids or circular tea-trays.
Noise of car simulated by confederates outside
shaking sleigh-bells or hand-bells, and drumming
on door with fingers and hand; also rattling
on floor with feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

Bell rings, by knocking goblet with spoon. Car
stops.</p>

<p>Passengers rush towards car. Gentleman is in
the act of stepping on car when bell rings, and car
suddenly starts off, throwing gentleman violently
to the ground. Great screaming and wailing;
friends gather round and try to raise him; find he
is insensible; all immediately begin shaking their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
fists at conductor; then simultaneously they bethink
themselves of the propriety of taking the
number of the car. All draw out their memorandum-books
and commence writing. Conductor and
driver make gestures of defiance.</p>

<p>Finding all these promises are of no use, he

his hat, rams it on his head, and exits. Lady walks
off in the opposite direction, clenching her fists.</p>

<span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Backyard of city house, with small table
placed on top of other table, to represent window.</i></p>

<p>Enter cat (head done up in brown paper, with
cat's face painted on it, brown paper ears, tail made
out of lady's boa, black silk handkerchief, or any
suitable thing).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Old gentleman gets very angry, shakes both his
fists, withdraws into room, reappears with hair-brush,
which he throws at cat. Cat continues
to make a noise. Old gentleman commences a
fusilade of boots, books, combs, and toilet articles
generally. Cat makes more noise than ever, putting
up her back and spitting at the objects as they
fell around her. The old gentleman is almost in
despair, when suddenly a bright idea strikes him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
which he expresses by pantomime, placing his
finger to the side of his nose and winking. He
disappears from the window. Presently is heard
the rattling of a chain and barking of a dog.</p>

ends of tinware, old rags, etc. Donkey very obstinate;
driver beats him with roll of stiff paper.
Servant hails soap-fat man and offers for sale several
large jarsful of drippings, sheets, pillow-cases,
etc., belonging to her mistress. They chaffer for
some time over the bargain, but finally agree upon
a price. The money (all copper pennies) is about
to change hands when the donkey, close by, gives
an unearthly bray, which, to their guilty consciences,
sounds like the voice of some avenging spirit; both
scream, drop the money on the floor, and rush off;
donkey turns round and runs off too.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p>Those tranquil moods to which allusion has
already been made on several occasions, have now
become a decided feature in our character. There is
certainly something very charming in the society of
well-bred women. However, we hope before long
we need not be forced from home to find that enjoyment.
We have discovered the object of Nix's
recent gifts of Brahminical works. It was a ponderous
roundabout species of humor peculiar to
Nix, the works in question being supposed to furnish
appropriate study for a person in our presumed
position as admirer of Bud (or Boodh).</p>

<p>Nix has for some time past made himself very
wearisome with continual allusions to Vishnu,
Siva, Buddhism, and so forth. We gained one
idea, however, from his jest. We have written a
Hindoo play, the plot of which turns on the love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
a devout Brahmin. The play is entirely finished
save the last act, which is complete up to the point
where Neer Je Haun declares his love for the Unblown
Rose.</p>


<h4>THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY.</h4>

<p>We took our play to the Adams' to-night, and
told Bud that it was nearly completed, but we were
in some embarrassment how to conclude it. We
had consequently come to consult her on the subject,
begging at the same time she would give it
her most careful attention, as her decision was of
vital importance. We were alone. We had read
the whole play through with the utmost care, till
we came to the final sentence in our manuscript,
where the hero declares his passion for the Unblown
Rose. It runs thus:</p>

<p><i>Neer Je Haun.</i> "Light of my soul, whose voice is
sweeter than the murmur of the Ganges, whose
name is incense to my nostrils, whose eyes are
brighter than the fire-flies by night&mdash;my highest
ambition is to be thy slave, my greatest hope to
guard thee from harm, to bask in the radiance of
thine eyes. For thee I would sacrifice all other
earthly happiness. When I pray thee to share my
humble fortunes, turn not away thy proud head;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
parch not my soul with scorn, though well I should
deserve such a fate for my temerity."</p>

<p>Now turning to Bud, we asked her to decide what
answer the lover should receive; should he be
accepted or rejected?</p>

<p>"Oh, accepted, of course!" eagerly exclaimed
Bud, her bright eyes kindling with sympathy for
the ardent Hindoo.</p>

<p>"It is well!" we replied, and wrote down the
maiden's answer.</p>

<p>"I will trust my life in thy hands from this day
till death."</p>

<p>"Is that right?" we asked.</p>

<p>She said it was, though perhaps a little cold.</p>

<p>We then drew from our breast pocket one sheet
of the manuscript she had not yet seen. It was
the title of the play:</p>


<h4>THE WORSHIP OF BUD.</h4>

<p>Bud colored&mdash;looked at us in an embarrassed
way, and then with much hesitation was about to
speak, when we stretched out our hand and
said:</p>

<p>"You will not make us alter what we have
written?"</p>

<p>She gave no answer, but from the pressure of
her hand we knew we need doubt no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this heathen idolator would not change
places with the greatest Christian monarch in
Europe.</p>
